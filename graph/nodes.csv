La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.

I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.<br /><br />They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.<br /><br />My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it.

What you get here is a full bag of chips. What\'s great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair.

If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience.

I appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably. I have agreed to take a shipment each month.', 'I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!', 'My family is on the last box.  My oldest daughter ate most of the cookies.  She likes peanut butter more than anything, and these 100-calorie pouches had just the right amount and they taste great.', 'These are more like a cracker - good for a little fill in for between meals.', ""I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you."", 'These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey\'s or Reese\'s crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these ""thin crisps"" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.', 'To be honest with you, I got these at a store.

I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually.<br /><br />I don\'t usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.<br /><br />What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar ""heaviness"" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I\'ve had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.<br /><br />I\'m a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it\'s a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.<br /><br />It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas.<br /><br />In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.<br /><br />5 stars.']"

Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture.', 'Skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil.  Not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful.', ""Just had my 1st can of these sardines and I am delighted!  Big sardines in the can with a most excellent mild flavor.  Made a tuna salad...but used sardines.  Wonderful!  I have to say that I really didn't notice that they were low sodium as far as affecting the overall sardine taste.  Love the ones without oil as I don't really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines.  I just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism, and I read that sardines are good to help restore your thryoid function.  I'll be ordering more of these!"", ""Roland S&B sardines are the best you can buy and believe me,  I've tried them all.

They do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well. Solid product. Even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby. Sardines are good for a person, everyone agrees on that.

Our son was on Enfamil Lipil from September 2007-September 2008.  He was breastfed and formula fed during this time.  Our daughter, who is due in January 2010, will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life.  We tried two other formulas with our son--Similac Advance and Parent\'s Choice.  The Similac was fine but clumped badly.  During the time we experimented with the Parent\'s Choice formula, my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu.  I think the Parent\'s Choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again.  I believe that Mead Johnson\'s decision to use prebiotics is a good one.  Our son had colic/acid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins.  He was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little Culturelle (a probiotic) in his formula in the evening.  And since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract, he had fewer sick days after introducing the Culturelle.  Probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker.<br /><br />Regarding the bpa found in formula can liners, I talked to an Enfamil customer service representative who told me that Mead Johnson now uses cans that are lined with a ""modified polyester"" that is bpa free.  Similac Advance Earlyshield comes in a bpa-free can also (the SimplePac container).<br /><br />Another concern parents have is the cost of formula.  Name brand formulas are expensive!  But if you think about it, you are feeding a human being for about $15 a week (a can usually lasts us 1.5 to 2 weeks).  $15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours!  And with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available--Bill Gates couldn\'t buy a better formula than what\'s on the shelves at Target or Wal-mart.<br /><br />If you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store (as I was in September 2007), I suggest starting with the flagship formula of either Mead Johnson (Enfamil Premium Lipil), Abbott Laboratories (Similac Advance Earlyshield), or Nestle (Good Start Gentle Plus or Good Start Protect Plus).  They are all excellent infant formulas.  You just have to see what works for you and your baby.']"

However, some people don\'t like fresh, soft goat chesses and one of the reasons that I send them this selection is so that they can try a variety of different chesses.  However, in the selection that I was sent it contained two versions of Chevre-type cheeses including the delicious Buche de Chevre.

I can certainly understand why substitutions would be necessary and I felt that they replaced the listed cheese with an even better variety.

I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried - served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water/ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.<br /><br />A little more about ""The Switch""... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with ""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"". One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.<br /><br />That being said, I can\'t see myself drinking ""The Switch"" everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair, I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still, for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend ""The Swtich"". The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang.', 'For those that want a more ""natural"" soft drink, this is a good option because it has no added sugars. It still manages to pack 140 calories in an 8oz bottle so don\'t drink this regularly if you\'re trying to lose weight. The taste has good complexity but like most fruit drinks, is a little too sweet for my taste. I would definitely drink this instead of a typical artificial orange soda though.', ""This sparkling juice drink has a decent and refreshing flavor, though somewhat reminiscent of the canned orange juice (can't remember the brand) I had once in awhile as a kid.<br /><br />It's a nice idea to have a soda that has no added sugar, though the juice combination isn't as impressive as the name might sound. This beverage contains a mix of the following juices (reconstituted with sparkling water)"", 'There are no surprises here. The label promises a perfect blend between juice and carbonation, and that is exactly what Switch delivers', ""Here we have a refreshing drink, not one you'd want to drink three of in a row but just one for a picker-upper or to quench an urgent thirst.<br /><br />The flavor (orange-tangerine) is subject to peoples' personal tastes but I liked it okay. It's not the best drink I've ever tried but it's okay for something different. People will have to make their own choice as to whether to buy it or not in regard to the price.<br /><br />Unfortunately, either the manufacturer, the Amazon Vine people, or both, goofily (is there such a word...? if not, I just invented it) placed two useless stickers on the can which covered half of the nutrition facts on the can. There was plenty of space to put them elsewhere but some non-thinker failed to use his or her marketing sense. So all I can tell you on that topic is that there is a 1% sodium content, total carbs are 30 grams, and there are 140 calories per 8.3 ounce serving (1 can.)<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this product but that's chiefly because I normally drink only non-sugar beverages."", ""Not too sweet, not overly carbonated - can be best described as a good orange punch mixed with Perrier.  And while it is all natural, it is also reconstituted.<br /><br />And that's the rub, while tasty (tangerine is the most prevalent flavor with hints of white grape and a slight grapefuit finish), this is basically just expensive, carbonated juice.  Can size is the same as a Red Bull, 8.3 oz versus the industry standard 12 oz serving.<br /><br />Is more better? Not necessarily, but then again sometimes less is just less.  At approximately $2 per can, which category The Switch Orange Tangerine is, is for you to decide."", ""This tastes great and I like that it's more natural than most other sodas available. Basically, it's a carbonated juice.  I generally prefer a larger 12 oz. size though."", 'I enjoyed the taste... It is close to orange soda initially but then there is another sweet taste at the end of each sip.  But unlike orange soda, this is healthier and no added sugars.  Even though this product tastes like orange soda I think it would do well for breakfast.  It may even become preferred over traditional orange juice for children and for businesses that worry about short shelf life.  On the downside, the price is a little high for such a small can when buying 24.', 'I thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market, called Izze, that has fewer calories, tastes better and costs less. However, Switch has a weird artificial aftertaste. It tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda, but not in a good way. Also, with 140 calories per serving (8.3 ounces) and 34 grams of sugar, you might as well drink soda- because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper.', ""If you like the sort of carbonated fruit punch that you get at, e.g., office holiday parties (where alcohol is verboten), you'll probably like The Switch"", ""While Switch Orange is VERY orangey, it also tastes of something else interesting. It's fizzy (but not, in my opinion, excessively so) and tasty, and I'd consider buying it. I seldom buy or drink soft drinks or sodas; I just don't care for all the fizz burning my nose. Switch didn't do that. Hurray!!!"", ""Hubby and I both shared the dring and we both liked it.  I really liked the fact that there was no added sugar in this drink.  It's a nice combination of flavors.  I found it a little too carbonated but he thought it was just right.<br /><br />I would buy it if it came in a larger can. Hence only 4 stars. I think this can is too small.  Too much aluminum thrown out.  I recyle everything but most people I know just toss it.  Otherwise I would buy this drink."", ""I drink too much soda. I've started looking for alternatives and one of the things I've tried is switch. I first tried it because while it's like an orange soda, it's really carbonated juice.<br /><br />I like"", 'It is so hard to find a nice juice drink that is either too sugary or, even worse, has additives like artificial sweeteners. The Switch Orange Tangerine delivers on flavor. If you like juice and want a full-flavored orangy-carbonated fizzy drink, this one fits the bill. Very good!', 'Refreshing and light.  A little on the sweet side but not overly sweet.  I enjoyed the orange flavor!', 'I am not one for ""canned"" juice drinks, but this one was exceptional in flavor. I am also not a big fan of orange flavored drinks but the tangerine is distinctive and nice.  It kind of reminded me of one of my favorite soft drinks in the world, Ting (from Jamaica) which is made from real grapefruit juice. Very nice, if you need more Vitamin C in your life I would consider buying it.', 'I split this can with my spouse.  I would have given it 2 stars, he gave it 3.  Nice idea, 100% carbonated juice, but the taste is pretty mild.  Not really what I would call refreshing.  Good idea, though, I would try it in other flavors.', ""Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan."", ""No caffeine, no high fructose corn syrup, 100% juice, nothing artificial. What's not to like?<br /><br />I hate to write anything negative because I don't want to discourage development of any products that avoid HFCS. But, to be honest, The Switch Orange Tangerine doesn't smell very good. If you're familiar with Airborne Cold Remedy, well, it smells like that. I think I was expecting a fragrance like Tang instant beverage. I certainly didn't expect it to smell like it does. It's not all that bad, it's just not real good.<br /><br />I also think this product would actually taste better if it weren't carbonated.<br /><br />The calories are about the same as a typical soda. But they're fruit juice calories instead of HFCS, so that's a big plus in my book."", ""Everyone at my house, even my mother-in-law, enjoyed this drink.  It tastes very much like a quality soda, but is made with 100% real juice.  Small cans mean you don't consume a lot of calories at once, because although this is healthier than regular soda, you shouldn't drink too much -- it's still a lot of sugar."", ""With all-natural ingredients and mostly real fruit juice, I'm not expecting this drink to taste like soda, punch, or anything like that, but I when I tasted it, I felt myself wanting more. I could really taste the orange-flavor coming though, but they somehow missed me on the tangerine side. Tangerines are very sweet, so I was expecting that to be the predominant flavor, but instead what I tasted was mostly orange, which left a somewhat sour/bitter aftertaste in my mouth. This drink wasn't bad, but given a choice, I'd rather drink orange juice or tangerine juice with seltzer. I don't see how this drink improves beyond that. Switch's other available flavors tasted much better, so in some ways this was a disappointment."", ""I didn't like this carbonated juice.  Although it appears to be all juice (not artificial flavors) it tastes somewhat artificial.  Perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice (which tastes NOTHING like REAL orange juice)!  I fully expected to like this as I do like fizzy fruit juice drinks.  This one did not do it for me."", ""Perfect size can and a refreshing drink. I think it's proof that simple is best. This would be my first choice for a drink if I were out and about."", 'I like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies I used to eat as it has a similar flavour. The thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories.  I also found that the can needed to be bigger as I wanted more at the end!', ""Yeah it's gluten free and whatever, but unless that's a really big issue for you and you're having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten-free diet, there's no real draw to this drink over say, orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks. I thought it was massively overly sweet, and I have something of a sweet tooth. The orange flavor wasn't particularly authentic or delicious, and it left a sour aftertaste. I got a free sample this time, and I cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again. On an environmental note, packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste, and I don't appreciate that either. Not a fan."", 'Switch definitely managed to keep its carbonated juice drink\'s intended flavor fresh. Though just a combination of sparkling water, the juice concentrates of several fruits (including apples, grapes and oranges) and, oddly enough, soy, it definitely maintains its taste of tangerine.<br /><br />I\'d love to see what other flavors Switch has to offer, with my only hesitation coming from ""natural flavors and colors."" But, hey, I\'m willing to grant them a little leeway in that department thanks to the NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP!', ""It's very refreshing to find products without sugar added, but make no mistake, this tiny can still packs a solid 34 grams of sugar, enough to give you an energy rush followed by the typical adrenal fatigue crash.  Perhaps you can sip just a few ounces every few hours to avoid the crash?<br /><br />The flavor is very good and will tempt you to chug the whole can in one quick drink.  Not exactly a health drink, but it's a nice improvement over the usual junk sold as a soft drink."", ""Nice alternative.  Very lightly carbonated.  I'd say if a normal carbonated drink ranges from 80 to 100 on the fizzy scale, this one's about an 11.<br /><br />At 26 grams, it's still a lot of sugar (mostly from apple and grape juice, I think).  I'll order a case just 'cuz I thought it was good and I'm calling it 4 stars - but honestly, I'd rather have it 50% splenda or stevia sweetened."", 'I was surprised at the ingredient list and ""100% natural"" stamped on the side, because this drink tasted just like a compeletely artifical energy drink. This is going to be a short review for me, because I don\'t really have much else to say. I could barely tell it was orange, because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits. My wife was especially confused- she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here.<br /><br />I know this isn\'t an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just can\'t reconcile the taste with the ingredients. If you\'re the sort of person who drinks some fresh fruit juice and thinks ""I really wish this tasted more like a completely artifical enegry drink instead of natural fruit juice"", then this is the product you\'ve been dreaming of.', 'At 22.99 for a pack of 24 cans of Switch orange Tangerine, you\'re paying about 96 cents per can. Is it worth it? Not really. First of all, you drink juice for health reasons. Vitamins, frutose over corn syrup and the like. Carbonating beverages generally aren\'t considered good for you, so it\'s odd that the two would be mixed.<br /><br />Besides the carbonation, and the aluminum can (which has been proved can lead to Alzheimer\'s) there\'s a lot of deceptive marketing going on. The can claims that Switch is 100% juice, but it\'s not actually 100% Orange and Tangerine juice. In fact, the drink is mostly apple and grape juice. You can taste this instantly, along with the metallic tang of being in a can. This is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine. So really, you\'re getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink.<br /><br />You\'re also gettinbg ""Natural flavours and colours"" which kind of kills the whole ""100% juice"" claim.<br /><br />With a taste that is both metallic and not really resembling the flavours it claims, I can\'t really recommend this product, You can generally buy boxed 100% juice for less, which contains more flavour, no aluminum and no carbonation.', ""I didn't really like the taste of this product much.  It has an artificial taste to me, even though it is juice and water.  It is a carbonated drink and it somewhat reminded me of the taste of baby aspirin, although not quite that bad.  I did drink the whole can.  The 8.3 oz can is narrow, compared to the 12 oz soda can you are used to seeing.<br /><br />The can says it is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and gluten free.  The nutrition box indicates (for the entire 8.3 oz can) 15mg sodium, 36g carbs, 34 g sugar, Vitamin C 100 %, Vitamin A 20%.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows and are listed in the following order"", 'After taking my first sip of Switch Orange/Tangerine, I raised a suspicious eyebrow because it didn\'t taste the way I expected it to. Then it dawned on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake, amped-up ""Orange"" soda, but what I was tasting was real, natural juice. Yes, I knew that from the label, but that\'s not the same as experiencing it.<br /><br />The taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine, not too sweet, and the carbonation adds a nice touch. A bit like a non-alcoholic Mimosa cocktail.<br /><br />My only reservation is that the calorie count is (perhaps unavoidably) too high for me to drink this on a regular basis - though let me be quick to point out that this is a ""no sugar added"" product. For those who aren\'t counting calories, a nice refreshing ""Switch"" from soft drinks!', 'This drink is a nice blend of juices (mostly orange) and carbonated water.  There are no other ingredients.  It has a decent amount of natural sugars from the juice, so it is not a low-calorie drink.  I thought the balance of flavors and sweetness was quite nice and would definitely buy again.', 'In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices', 'Switch Orange/Tangerine is billed as the natural alternative to sodas and/or artificially-sweetened juice drinks.  However, I found it to be pretty ordinary.<br /><br />First the good stuff', 'This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda.  While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it\'s lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn\'t make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I\'d go with Hansen\'s sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.<br /><br />The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn\'t get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don\'t get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.<br /><br />Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn\'t make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn\'t give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.<br /><br />Not recommended, sorry.', ""I'm not sure what I expected - maybe something thin and bubbly - but Switch delivers a rich, full orange-tangerine flavor.<br />It's got a lot more flavor, and good flavor at that, and a bit less carbonation than other carbonated fruit drinks.<br />An 8 ounce can has 140 calories, no fat, 15mg of sodium, 35 grams of carbs, 34 grams of sugar (they claim no sugar added), and no protein.

I probably could overlook that if Switch was really, really delicious, but frankly it\'s not.

There\'s no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates, and that\'s fine, I\'d prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners.  In my opinion, juice doesn\'t need to be sweetened.  I suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice, so I wonder why it\'s as expensive as it is.<br /><br />What makes me scratch my head is the notation ""Contains soy.""  What?  Why?  Why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler?  Honestly, I\'d buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before I\'d buy Switch.

That would result in a higher price, though not sure how much higher than the almost $1/can price it's being offered as a grocery item (imagine the price in a vending machine).<br /><br />For this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice, then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice (a fruit high in Vitamin C and apparently popular in Puerto Rico and Barbados).

It\'s a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz.', 'I\'ve become a fan of The Switch sodas. The black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas. The Orange flavor; however, leaves a lot to be desired.

Generally I enjoy drinking naturally flavored sparkling water like La Croix or Crystal Geyser. I also very much enjoy Izzy's sparkling water/juice blends. Unlike Izzy, which combines juice and water, this is a 100% juice beverage that is carbonated. I have to say, it is definitely full of flavor, but it's just too sweet tasting. I like a bit of orange juice now and then, but for this type of carbonated drink, I'm just not into all that sweetness. I tried diluting it with some sparkling water, but the flavor just wasn't quite what I wanted. I like that Izzy is just a bit on the tart side with it's flavors. This is a nice idea and it's pretty ok. I just prefer other beverages over this one."", 'This drink has a wonderful orange citrus flavor.  It is robust but not too strong.

It tastes very similar to mandarin orange Slice but it uses natural juices and no HFCS.  If you are very concerned about artificial flavors and HCFS, but still want a carbonated drink, then Switched may be a good alternative.  I read the ingrediants list and it mainly included reconstituted juces and then aboiut another line of preservatives and additives, I would assume similar to those in commercial fruit juices.<br /><br />Personally, I am more concerned about overall sugar and calories in my soft drinks so this little 8 oz can has 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.  If memory serves me that is in line with the calories of most softdrinks and more sugar then most soft drinks.<br /><br />Ultimately, i think this is a good tasing product, but the touted benefits doesn't outweigh the increased price and availability conpared to regualar soda.

Not sweet enough for her.<br />I think it's a little pricey, not sure I'd be willing to plunk down that much for it~~the can is very small, 8.3 fl. ozs., which is a proper serving of orange juice, which makes it around $1 a can, or a little less.<br />But overall I truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste!!"", ""This is for sure not what I was expecting it to taste like.

It is labeled as ""all-natural"" because the sugars in it come from fruit juices rather than added corn syrup.  I chilled the can of Switch in my refrigerator overnight, and then sampled it poured over ice in a glass.  The color is not so ""neon"" orange as some orange sodas -- it is a softer orange color.  The fizz is also less than in a regular soft drink.<br /><br />I found the flavor pleasing, with none of the chemical or metallic taste which can occur in many brands of orange soda.  The soft fizziness of the drink complemented the orange flavor well.  I didn\'t really get a true tangerine taste from the soda.  Tangerines are a very acidic fruit, and have a very distinct taste, which I did not really get from this soda.  However, the taste is very smooth and quite refreshing.  My teenaged daughters and their friends loved this soda, and I have been re-ordering it every so often as a treat.<br /><br /> Switch is a bit pricy.  You can cut down on the price by signing up for regular deliveries, but so far I haven\'t given in to that temptation.  However I am buying it for special occasions, for the travel cooler, and for planned teen get-togethers.', ""This one tasted pretty good.  Very tangy, but in a 'real fruit' kind of way.

If I were thirsty at all, I would want way more, at least 12 oz.  The only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks, and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink.

There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a ""natural"" beverage.<br /><br />I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Orange Tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what I am used to as juice flavor.<br /><br />The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer.<br /><br />The tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda, but the orange and tangerine flavors don\'t last as long as soda flavors do on the palate.<br /><br />I would drink this again on a hot day if I could buy it inexpensively enough.', 'At first, I really wanted to like this drink. ""The Switch"" tasted like tangerines and had a good aroma. The drink is carbonated, but not really strongly so. It is pleasant. However, after a few seconds, an after taste developed that was a little bitter. My wife thought this after taste was even a little ""off"", but she has a more sensitive palate than I do. In any case, the net effect was that I would just as soon have Orangina, and I won\'t be going out to buy more of ""The Switch"" Orange Tangerine.

It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.<br /><br />It's not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.<br /><br />Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.<br /><br />As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.

The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste.

Overall, a good, refreshing pick me up, but you may want to drink more then one."", ""My daughter & I were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice.  This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more. My son also tried it and didn't care for it.

Both are light and refreshing and WAY better than fruit-flavored waters. YUK! You can tell by the taste these are definitely fruit juices but without the sticky, thick, sweetness of a non-carbonated drink. This orange tangerine flavor though - there's this weird taste to it one that hits you immediately. Not quite bitter, not quite metallic, but definitely not yummy - unless you like bitter fruit - not sour - bitter. Maybe it's too much carbonation for my taste. If you've tried the other flavors and are looking to try something new - think twice about this one. It is tingly and refreshing, but I won't order it again."", ""I didn't mind the taste of this very much - it tasted like Minute Maid OJ mixed with soda.  My husband couldn't stand it at all.  My only issue with this was that it was a heavy-syrup sort of flavor that was a little overwhelming.

However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created a 12 ounce can and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase it.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.', 'I did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste; it is orange juice infused with carbonation.

The taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine, and for me that made it taste more Orange-ish than Orange.  As others have noted, the amount of calories and sugar are not that different from a cola, so it\'s not really clear that it\'s THAT much healthier than other sodas.<br /><br />Personally though, I\'d rather just grab a glass of orange juice or eat an orange instead.

In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking real orange juice.<br /><br />The can is also thinner then a soda can so you're not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke.  This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free.  It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you.  While not a perfect drink it's one I enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future."", ""I have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners, and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup.  The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.<br /><br />The Switch has several flavors, including Orange Tangerine.  However, it's clear some flavors are better than others.  The Orange Tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor I tried does not.  I've tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them, but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda.  If you're looking for an orangey soda, try Izze's Sparking Clementine instead."", 'This was a very interesting drink! It was refreshing, tasty and healthy! It was very Tangerine tasting, no after taste and very refreshing!', ""This is a wonderful alternative to soda pop.  It's delicious, refreshing and most of all, natural.  I ordered the Tangerine/Orange.  I'm anxious to try the other flavors.  My only gripe is that the cans are rather small.

Good taste, pleasant carbonation, fun can.<br /><br />Ok, so all it is is carbonated fruit juice.... big deal, right?

The soda is tasty and quite fizzy, I think it has more carbonation than Fanta which goes flat easier.  The can is the typical size of an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink merely another fruit flavored soda.  It is flavored naturally, but that is the only difference from regular soda type drinks."", 'I enjoyed this drink. It has good fizz and flavor. Ingredients include apple/grade juices as the main fruit elements. Tangerine, orange and acerola (type of wild cherry) round out the other fruit juices. For my taste, this is not citrusy enough. I find an Orangina to have better flavor, but it is loaded with added sugars (high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient in Orangina)! I also compare this to the Izze version and the Izze wins for flavor. I think the health benefits of The Switch or Izze drinks outweigh the flavor differences though, and if I was but one of these types of drinks, I would not look at Orangina again.', 'I love this flavor the best for it lightness, but zesty and orange tanginess.

The down side over the last number of years is the high fructose corn syrup that has replaced sugar in the carbonated sodas.<br /><br />But, of late there have been alternatives. First there was Orangina, which mixed 12% orange juice with carbonated soda - still had the sugar, but far better than mainstream sodas. Then a number of drinks have become available that mix the carbonation with a high percentage of real fruit juices. Some of these have been underwhelming to say the least. The best so far is IZZE with its 70% fruit juice and 30% carbonated water - no added sugars.<br /><br />Now comes along The Switch. The Switch is 100% fruit juice with carbonation added. And, like IZZE, I really like this drink. It is different than IZZE drinks; The Switch blends their juices different to achieve a little more subtle flavor where IZZE has more tang and punch. I can't say one is better than the other only that they each deliver a different refreshing experience.<br /><br />I have tried The Switch in Orange Tangerine and Black Cherry. The Orange Tangerine is very good! I highly recommend it. The Black Cherry is good, better than some other cherry drinks of this sort I have had, but it could be a bit better; it doesn't quite deliver the same flavor experience of a really good Black Cherry soda."", 'As part of Amazon\'s Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href=""http', 'Very Natural flavor.

At 140 cal.can, it certainly isn\'t low-cal, but there is no added HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) or sugar. The surprisingly high price is also a downside.

It contains 100% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C, and 20% of your Vitamin A for the day.

Perhaps you've tried Crystal Geyser's Fruit Squeeze beverages which are also similar. It's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages (Sunkist, Crush). It has a hint of grapefruit-like taste to it, but without the bitterness, which may be due to the added apple, grape, and acerola concentrates. The aftertaste is a bit metallic to me. The beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light-orange-yellow in color.<br /><br />This is a good alternative to those looking for something soda-like, but healthier than all the HFCS-loaded options. Maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway. Personally, I don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available, similar products.

It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation - almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape.

Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.

It\'s also gluten free so that\'s good news for those who are trying to watch what they eat and drink.<br /><br />The 8.3-ounce can is smaller than the standard 12-ounce can of soda and maybe it just takes a couple of tries to get used to the flavor.<br /><br />Like I said, not bad but I\'ll stick with regular/diet soda.

My biggest beef with the brand is that it is just super hard to find, which has now been resolved.  I have to say that I don't love the orange-tangerine flavor, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five;  I just don't really like orange flavored drinks but did like how this one had more tangerine flavor than straight-up orange.

Otherwise, pass these up."", 'Dare I be corny and say, ""Make a switch to The Switch?""  This soda has a great orange-tangerine taste.  It is juice with carbonation, therefore, it can tout that it is all natural, without any added sugars.

It was actually more highly carbonated than I was expecting, but didn\'t taste dry the way I would expect an artificial-sugar-free drink to taste with carbonation added.

While I would probably purchase the other flavors of Switch, I definitely would not purchase this one."", ""So far I've only tried the Orange Tangerine flavor and it's pretty good overall.  It does have a tangerine taste to it, though it's accompanied by other flavors.  It's clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10% juice drinks since it's just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs. the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in something like Sunkist.  I think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage.  It does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange, but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider.  I think straight carbonated orange/tangerine juice would probably be a bit much.  The Switch reminds me of Appletiser, which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years, but is still pretty hard to find in the US.<br />That having been said, I had to dock one star for a couple of reasons.  First, the cans just seem too small.  If they're sticking with aluminum cans, I'd like to see the standard 12oz size offered.  It seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines.  Alternately, 16 or 20oz bottles would also work.  The second issue is the price.  While I understand there's a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup, the current price still seems high, even in comparison to other juice drinks.  That might be partly because it's from a relatively small company that doesn't yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of Coke and Pepsi can take advantage of, but it still seems like the price could come down a bit (or at least serving size could increase without a price increase) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume.<br />I pick up Appletiser when I can find it, and I'll likely do the same with The Switch, at least from time to time."", 'I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.<br /><br />The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.<br /><br />I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim ""no additional sugar"" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams.', 'This drink tastes just like soda to me.

There are plenty of vitamin and flavored waters and sports drinks that would serve the same purpose without all those calories. If I want a soda, I certainly wouldn\'t pay a lot of money for something that tastes just like it but costs 4 times as much (at a guess). I do love the taste of Fanta, though.', 'This is my second can of ""The Switch"" that I\'m reviewing under the Amazon Vine program. And while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues -- it\'s over priced at almost $1 for a mere 8.3oz can in a 24 pack, but more importantly it really just doesn\'t taste like orange or tangerine at all. The ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type. Now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink? Now don\'t get me wrong, it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste...but the flavor isn\'t all that appealing.<br /><br />I love orange juice, drink it every day. I\'d love to try carbonated orange juice...but this is far from that. It MIGHT be a good substitute for normal soda for kids, but I can\'t imagine any other real reason to get this.', 'Note', 'I really enjoyed this drink.  It tasted just like an orange soda, but I liked it more because it was 100% juice, and didn\'t have any extra additives.<br /><br />The only negative is that since it is 100% juice (and has no artificial sweeteners) it is high in calories -140 calories to a can, to be exact.<br /><br />However, if I were to choose between drinking this or drinking an apple or orange juice, I definitely would drink this as a treat.  Plus, it would be really fun to pack in a cooler, especially for the young ones in your family.<br /><br />Please note, it is not just a single type of juice.  It is a blend of several juices, so it is not ""carbonated OJ"", it is something just a little different.', ""I also reviewed the Jones Soda Berry Pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over $1 per bottle.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor. It's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) which gives it a lot of tang/bite. For me it isn't unpleasant at all - I like it.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviews, I don't get the medicine aftertaste. It's just a good, refreshing, carbonated drink. I tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst. I tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great. I like it over ice better, though. Then, just for fun, I added some Malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and it's not bad. I won't be asking for it at a bar, but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and I think if someone was creative, this could be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />The down side (to me) is this is another fairly pricey drink. The cans aren't full-size cans either. So for almost $1 per can you get a smallish 8.3 ounces but with regular sodas you get 12 ounces - half again as much. Of course, sodas aren't 100% juice either.<br /><br />Upshot is if I'm on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty, I'd probably buy this.

To my disappointment, it tasted more like fruit punch, perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it. I would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the apple-grape combo, not just in the flavor department, but in the sweetness. It\'s sticky icky sweet, more than any of the cheaper brands (Sunkist, Crush and others) of orange soda, or the higher priced goodies like Orangina and the delectable Izze.<br /><br />It is fairly healthy however, with no bad stuff and quite a lot of Vitamin C (100% based on 2,000 calorie intake), All Natural, etc. My recommendation is for more orange, less apple/grape, or change the label flavor to ""mixed fruit."" It\'s 140 calories per cute little 8.3 oz can, and if you\'re not expecting orange you may like it.

I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.

Yes, you get to experience the taste of juicy oranges and tangerines, but there are other flavors present as well and I couldn't quite put my finger on these other flavors until I read the ingredients and discovered that The Switch Orange Tangerine is also made with apple and grape juices. The grape is barely noticeable, but the apple can be detected and it, along with added soy, is responsible for the interesting taste sensation that you experience in the aftertaste.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is billed as a health drink and it does, indeed, have many positive selling points in terms of composition and nutrition. There is no added sugar, no artificial colors, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. The beverage is also gluten- free and provides one- hundred percent of the USRDA for Vitamin C and twenty percent of the USRDA for Vitamin A. There is no fat and no protein, either. But there are thirty- four grams of sugars and a fairly high level of calories. Granted, these are natural sugars but thirty- four grams is still a large amount and it won't be acceptable to those on low carb diets.  And with almost seventeen calories per ounce, the caloric content is higher than that of most soft drinks.<br /><br />So, are there enough reasons to make the switch to The Switch Orange Tangerine? My answer is yes, due to both its good, refreshing taste and its better than average nutritional content.

The carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well.', 'The Switch Orange Tangerine drink is one of the many beverages out there that are trying to offer soda drinkers a slightly healthier alternative without sacrificing the flavor.  No mistake should be made to think that Switch is primarily a fruit drink.  Although it contains 100% juice, Switch is a soda first and a fruit beverage second.  The carbonation, combined with the various citrus flavors, make Switch taste a bit like Mountain Dew with an extra orange kick.<br /><br />Soda fans who like Mountain Dew but want something made of juice should love Switch, as it does offer a slightly healthier alternative to the standard carbonated drink.  Since there are so many fruit juices present each can has 100% of the daily recommended Vitamin C and 20% of the daily recommended vitamin A.  The lack of artificial preservatives does also give it a slightly more crisp taste.<br /><br />It\'s important to note that Switch isn\'t ""sugar free,"" but rather has ""no sugar added.""  The distinction is missed by many, and could be very important for diabetics or anyone watching their sugar intake.  The drink actually has 34 grams of sugar in each can, but since it\'s coming from the fruit juice and not from high fructose corn syrup it\'s less of a problem for anyone looking for a more healthy drink.<br /><br />The biggest factor in deciding if Switch will be worthy anyone\'s time depends entirely on how much they enjoy carbonated citrus drinks.  Soda fans who want a fruitier and less artificial drink will probably love Switch.  People who just want fruit juice and don\'t enjoy the carbonated flavor should probably avoid, however.', 'In fact, I did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink.

Proceed with caution. Perhaps kids would find it super tasty."", 'As the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste. Granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys (high fructose syrup and coloring)but the taste is mediocre. This is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste.

Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds. I am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement. I was switched off. Will this make you give up your favorite soda pop? Probably not. I like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that perky fizzing drink better than Switch. Not such a great product in my opinion.', 'The taste says fresh-squeezed quality fruit.

I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it\'s not Tang, it\'s Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn\'t care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.', ""Overall the drink was decent. It's tart and sweet at the same time. Switch is alright but might not be worth the money depending on how much you like it. I myself would prefer a Spicy V8 over this.

To get right to it, let us tackle the first claim. The can of Switch I got (Orange Tangerine) was 8.3 fluid ounces. Those 8.3 ounces contain 36g carbs, 34g sugars and 15g sodium and packs 140 calories. To put this in perspective, the 20 fluid ounce bottle of vanilla Coke sitting on my desk right now  contains 28g carbs, 28g sugars and 25mg sodium, and has 100 calories. In other words, a bottle of conventional soda 2.5x as large has less calories, less carbs, and less sugars. Granted, Switch has less sodium, but if we poured equivalent amounts of drink, i.e. 20 oz vs. 20 oz, it would have much more. The drawing power of Switch, then, is that it boasts 100% RDA of Vitamin C and 20% RDA of Vitamin A vs 0% in these categories for Coke, and that it has plenty of carbonation to satisfy the taste of soda-lovers. In my mind this doesn\'t quite balance the scale<br /><br />As to the second claim', 'The only good thing was that it was not sweet, but the taste was just bad. I could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink.  I have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks, and I have to say this is the least favorites of the 9 other carbonated orange drinks.  I prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice.', ""This product is tasty -- it's carbonated juice (a blend of several juices, mostly apple, grape, tangerine). But the 8.3 ounces costs $1 and contains 140 calories. This is a little rich for me, both economically and calorically. I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind spending their money and calories on juice."", ""The Switch Orange Tangerine sounded delicious when I ordered it. I thought it would be very refreshing on these hot summer days. And it would be if the taste were better. Perhaps the other flavors might be better but the orange tangerine had a bad aftertaste. Stick with the real juice if you want that flavor. The sparkling juice idea is good, I liked the carbonation as it was refreshing.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is the sugar. There was 34g of sugar in that little 8 oz. can. There is 40g in a 12 oz. can of Dr. Pepper. Way too much sugar.<br /><br />The other drawback for me is the price. I wouldn't buy it because it works out to be almost a dollar a can. If I'm going to pay that much, I would rather buy the regular juice (real, not reconstituted) in the store."", ""This product is a light and fruity carbonated beverage.  You might ask how that's different from any other soda.  The difference is that this one leans more on the fruit side rather than the soda or sugar side.  I liked that about it.  While it was sweet it wasn't syrupy sweet to the point that it was cloying and it did not have a strong after taste.  Also it had a much more juicy aspect to it.  Its kind of hard to describe but the best comparison I can make is it's like one of those fruity V8 juices only carbonated.  Maybe that's not right either but I'd recommend trying this at least once.  It just may be a taste you'll find you'll like again."", ""The citrus flavor is crisp and clear in this carbonated juice.

I like that you get a full dose of vitamin C, and a little bit of A.  As for taste, it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation, and it\'s very orange tangerine-y.  It\'s a little heavy (read syrupy without being too sweet), but it does have a reconstituted juice base, so it gets a pass.  It\'s also in a single serving-size can (8.3oz), which is nice considering I typically treat most 20oz bottles as a serving, even though it\'s 2 and a half and I tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what I\'m drinking.<br /><br />The Bad - The price is a bit steep.  At about a dollar a can, it\'s roughly twice the price as most 100% juices you can find, including most selections of orange juice.  Whereas a 64 ounce carton of Tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars, 8 cans of the Switch would cost eight bucks.  For soda lovers, the Switch is about twice the cost compared to your average 20oz bottle, and roughly 4 times the cost of cans (when comparing equal amount by the ounce.)  Also, read the ingredients, it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine, which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors (which doesn\'t mean oranges, just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically made.)<br /><br />The Ugly - The Switch seems straight forward, but it\'s also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint.  Granted it\'s all natural, but each 8oz can contains 36g of carbs, 34 of sugar alone.  That\'s more sugar than soda, in some cases by almost 10 grams a serving.  More sugar (even if it\'s not corn syrup) is more calories per can, so even at it\'s single serving size you\'d almost be better off drinking a Coke and taking a vitamin C pill.', 'The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a ""healthy"" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, I\'ll pass.', ""On the face of it, THE SWITCH Orange Tangerine beverage sounds quite good. It's a mix of concentrated fruit juices with mildly carbonated water. No added sugar, preservatives or caffeine are there to annoy the health-conscious. You get 140 calories from one 8.3 ounce can. (Probably too small a serving for most people.) There are small portions of natural flavor and coloring, gum acacia, ascorbic acid (i.e., Vitamin C) and soy. In case quantities, it's priced at under a dollar per can. Sounds pretty decent, right?<br /><br />The trouble is"", ""It's a small drink at just 8.3 ounces but that's probably the size drink we should all be consuming so I wont ding it on that point. It's made with good ingredients and as it says `No Sugar Added' but don't let that fool you into thinking it's low in sugar having 34 grams. A Coke contains 45g of sugar but it's almost 50% larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that's fully loaded. In defense of The Switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup. Obviously it has no caffeine which I have some issues with so that's a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at.<br /><br />So it can't be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar, carbs and calories from a similar size glass of Tropicana orange juice. So how is the taste? My wife described it as tasting like soap. I wouldn't go that far but I will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me. I wasn't a big fan and personally I'm going to stick with water and orange juice.... and beer."", ""I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though."", ""It has a nice taste.  Good for sipping.  If you drink soda or juice with your meals, this would be a decent alternative.  The tangerine taste is pronounced but not overpowering.  The carbonation is pleasant.<br /><br />However, it's not a drink I would normally imbibe.  I normally drink either water or beverages sweetened with something other than sugar.  And this has a LOAD of sugar.  Yes, they say it has no added sugar.  That's probably accurate.  But the natural sugar in the apple/tangerine/orange juices in this drink adds up to 34 grams.  Compare that to the same amount of Coke at 27 grams!  I checked a few other tangerine flavored sodas - they all had similar amounts of sugar as Switch.  I suppose tangerines are loaded with sugar.  Anyway, that's a lot more sugar than I normally drink.<br /><br />If the sugar isn't an issue, this is worth checking out."", ""This drink is very, very sweet, and only mildly carbonated.<br /><br />I don't drink soda, but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks. I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but it's not. The ingredients may be all-natural, but it's still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.<br /><br />For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. I'd still choose this over an orange soda, but i'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this.<br /><br />Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans."", ""I really enjoyed this drink!  I am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so I was very eager to try this drink.  It is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity!!!  The tangerine I believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste.  If you're trying to cut back on pop, I highly recommend this drink or even just for a refreshing treat!"", 'While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.', 'I ordered this product after enjoying a previous Vine acquisition--<a href=""http', ""I'm a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days, so this beverage idea really sounded good to me.  It doesn't contain a bunch of artificial junk in it, and it still tastes pretty good.  I could definitely drink more of these.  They won't ever be my favorite beverage, but then I'm more of a non-carbonated kind of drinker anyway.  This is definitely a good alternative to other products out there, and I'd like to try other flavors as well."", 'Switch is a decent soda, and definitely worth considering for those who want mainly natural ingredients. But I think it is overstating it a bit when the Switch can claims ""100 % of what you want and 0 % of what you don\'t want"" - or is soy something I would expect or want in a soda?<br /><br />For my personal taste, this Switch flavor (which was the only one I tried) was too sweet. It is hard to believe that there is no sugar added to that stuff.<br /><br />So - ok, but not great. I prefer <a href=""http', 'well, my husband, myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink. My husband hated it. I felt like it was OK, but nothing to write home about. The taste to me was too orangey and for a ""natural"" product it sure didn\'t taste like one. My 12 year old liked it. He also likes gummy worms and sour straws, so you can take his review for what it is.<br /><br />I personally wouldn\'t buy this product.<br />2 stars', ""To be blunt, I was throughly underwhelmed with this product and I am finding it hard to come up the words to describe why, but the problem is that orange SWITCH doesn't have a lot going for it, so there isn't a lot one can say about it.<br /><br />To me, this product is canned orange juice and club soda, packaged in a trendy little can.<br /><br />And like all canned orange juice (Blue Bird brand, et. al.) there is an off taste to it that reminds you it isn't fresh squeezed juice.  Add to that this fizzy aspect, and its just kinda, well, there.<br /><br />I can't say that this is a healthy drink - orange juice has some of the highest concentrations of sugars for a fruit drink.  And its cost per can is steep, especially when compared to making this stuff at home with club soda and fresh squeezed juice.<br /><br />I can't give it one star - I would reserve that for something undrinkable as Amazon requires a minimum one star to do a review.  So my two star rating should be taken to mean that you can drink it and its unoffensive, but thats about all you can say about it."", ""I  highly recommend Switch if you are looking for a soda that doesn't have refined sugar and is loaded with flavor.  Sweetened with fruit juice (as opposed to high fructose corn syrup), this will definitely quench your thirst.  Plus, all you Tangerine lovers out there, this is the next best thing to eating the actual fruit!"", ""A nutritionist once told me she could find something good about every food...except soda. Pop is full of CO2 (carbon dioxide), something our body is trying to get rid of, and refined sugar (which can ruin the teeth and provides empty calories). But even so, I still love it. I love the fizz tingling down my throat while while cleaning my palate and replacing it with sweetness. Nutri-sweet brings down the calories at the expense of flavor and has side effects like headaches and giving me a gnawing hunger.<br /><br />For fun occasions, I'll mix lemon-lime or plain soda water with juices for a delightful, and slightly healthier alternative to soda. Will the Switch Orange Tangerine soda live up to my expectations? A carbonated juice in a can?<br /><br />At first glance, the Switch can is...cute. It's a slender can with nice artwork. Fun to hold in your hand when you're used to the typical can.<br /><br />But when I taste it, I'm sorry to say, I'm a little disappointed. The Orange Tangerine Switch soda is not as tasty as regular orange soda, nor as orange juice. For a disclaimer, I'll mention that orange juice is not something that would normally taste great carbonated, so the other flavors of Switch might taste better. I got a kind of odd, bitter taste as I drunk the soda, but afterwards there was a pleasant aftertaste. The bitterness might be present in regular soda, but this is orange juice (with some others mixed in) and I know how it tastes without carbonation.<br /><br />I gave the Switch soda to both of my daughters who happily swigged it down with no concern from the odd taste I noticed.<br /><br />So while I won't be happily exchanging my occasional soda for Switch, I'm glad they are trying to do something a little healthier than we can feel more comfortable giving our children. And really, on a hot day, this would hit the spot."", 'I really enjoy trying new things, so I found the idea of this soda pleasing.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink.  I think this might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be.  However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this ""natural"" drink tastes a bit artificial.  This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always effects the flavor.  However, unlike the watermelon flavor, I found this variety vibrant and delicious.  The fruit flavor really comes through, including the often tricky tangerine.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.', ""I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!<br /><br />To give you an idea of what it tastes like"", ""I gave this a try because I love carbonated juice-stuff like bottled cranberry, apple, grape from Welch's and the like.<br /><br />Personally I liked this pretty well, though not as much as some other brands.  To me, it tastes and smells like tangerine, and I felt like I could kind of taste some of the component flavors making it up-the flavor is more complex than you'd get from a fruit flavored soda.  The carbonation is pretty light<br /><br />I definitely wouldn't mind trying some of `The Switch's other flavors...BUT, I split some of the tangerine flavor with a relative, and she thought it smelled like Jell-O, and didn't care for it-she said she'd rather have regular juice.<br /><br />I definitely liked this better than orange soda though!"", 'Firstly, I hate orange flavored sodas.

I thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight, which reminded me of <a href=""http', ""I really enjoyed this soda. I used to be a big fan of Orangina a few years ago but Switch Orange Tangerine is WAY better -especially if your looking for a true orangey taste. A cold one of these would be very refreshing on a hot summer day. Tastes sort of like real orange juice mixed with seltzer, which begs the question why not just mix it yourself?

Very tasty."", 'I have tried a couple different flavors of this soda and found it to be pretty good.Its lighter than regular soda.', 'The only way we could make Switch Orange-Tangerine drinkable was mixing 50/50 with club soda. It was just way too sweet. It then tasted good, but Orangina and San Pelligrino both have awesome Orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix!

It\'s not really good for you, it\'s just not directly bad for you. Sincerely, I\'m fairly sure that sucking on my couch cushions would garner you more nutrition than a Mountain Dew, so it\'s not like ""better than soda"" is really setting the bar high.<br /><br />Rather disappointing, particularly compared to the other Switch beverages.', 'This was pretty tasty, but orange has never been my favorite. I recommend it if you like oranged flavored drinks. I absolutely love the strawberry kiwi. These drinks are not too sweet, natural and refreshing I will continue to try them. My beverage of choice is water and milk (and wine ;0) )...but for an ocassional treat drinks like these are great.<br />Try them.', ""One of my longtime favorite drinks is a half-and-half combination of club soda and fruit juice. Most fruit juices by themselves are a bit too sweet for me (even the ones without added sugar), and the addition of carbonation just makes the whole thing more agreeable to me. This drink does this for me, and amazingly, they do not add a boatload of sugar. Too many off-the-shelf beverages--even those claiming to be healthful--have way too much sugar (or worse, the cheap corn syrup sugar substitute). These guys give it none of that. It's both tasty and refreshing. This is a product I would actually buy."", ""I really liked this drink.  It's 100% juice with no added sugar, so even though the sugar content is a little high, it has more nutrients than soda will have any day.  Switch tastes like tangy, carbonated orange drink, and that's fine with me!  I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.  But beware - each can is only 8.3 ounces, a little more than a cup.  You decide if it's worth it."", ""I like this 'Orange Tangerine' more than the other two of these drinks I reviewed previously"", 'First, I wish I had gotten two can samples of this product so I could try one with some bourbon.

If it's significantly more expensive than most drinks, leave it. Buy coke instead."", 'This is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there.  It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.<br /><br />The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.<br /><br />Overall, this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as I will usually want one or the other.<br /><br />Not bad, but not what I want.', ""It seems that soda wasn't as good as when I was a kid, and people have pointed out that it might be the high fructose corn syrup that is making the taste more dull.

However, at 140 calories per can, this beverage has 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda. Too many for me."", 'I tried Switch Orange Tangerine drink.  Excellent flavor and not so sweet as to make you feel you are getting a ton of sugar.  It has no added sugar and no corn sweetners, so, it is more natural than any other orange soda type drink.  More like a sparkling juice drink.  I have been a fan of orange juice and soda type drinks when as a kid I would mix OJ and Orange Soda.  Yet the natural taste of this drink is refreshing.  I tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing, if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues.<br /><br />Caution, it has 34 grams of sugar, and although natural, you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems.  34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar.  At least, if you like sparkling fruit drinks, check this one out.  I will next try it with added sparkling water to it.  Enjoy.', 'Switch has been the first ""soda alternative"" that I\'ve LOVED! It\'s got a delightful fresh fruit flavor, refreshing bubbles, and no aftertaste. It is sweet and juicy tasting, reminds me a little of Orange Crush.

If the price is right, doesn\'t hurt to try.', ""I've now tried several of the Switch drinks. They're not bad, for a carbonated juice drink, especially. This, actually, was one of the better flavors I've tried. It's got a nice orange juice type flavor that I enjoyed. Ultimately, these drinks remind me of Apple Beer, which is essentially carbonated apple juice. I love that drink, and think Switch could try an apple version of their product. I'm sure I'd love it as well...<br /><br />That being said, give it a try. It will quench your thirst, and I'm sure it'll do well in the marketplace. It fills a void where very few drink manufacturers have entered."", ""I don't know if it has changed since then, but when I lived in Australia 14 years ago, one thing that stood out to me was how real drinks tasted compared to the artificial flavors typical of America.  Switch brought me back to those days.  It starts out tangy and the taste turns sweeter in my mouth.  If they knocked 50 calories off, I would definitely purchase this regularly."", 'I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I\'m not particularly fond of Orangina that didn\'t help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.<br /><br />I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there\'s no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it\'s not enough to put me off from drinking it.<br /><br />The one thing that did put me off was the price. I\'ll admit that I\'m something of a ""cheap drinker"" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I\'m drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96¢ per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12¢ per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6¢ per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8¢ per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so it\'s about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn\'t factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)<br /><br />So I guess the bottom line here is, if you\'re really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process.', ""I always liked Orange Crush when I was a kid.

Perhaps it is because I like orange soda, and this drink seems to have all the elements of what I like in the soda without all the harmful ones. There is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors and it is gluten free.  This is especially great for someone with allergies, or those who are on restricted diets.  Add to that that it is 100% juice and tastes great and you have a winner.  I liked this product and plan to seek it out at my local store.']"

To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious']"

I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way.

You will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula. It's worth the time!  I live in an area that has very soft water, so I don't need as much product to brew a gallon.

Using a Mr. Coffee,(12 cup) Measure 3 Tablespoons (slightly rounded) and place in the filter (just as you would coffee) Fill you crafte to the max, and brew. For sweet tea, I use One and 1/4 cup sugar per gallon. It's  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher, then add the hot liquid. The sugar will dissolve completely, and you won't need as much sugar. When the sugar has dissolved, add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon.

This flavor is not always available as it is a limited edition flavor, but fear not, these cookies do very well when frozen and can go directly from the freezer to the microwave for about 40 seconds, and you have a nice chewy delicious cookie.<br /><br />This flavor is delicious-some of the major ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, raisins, dried apples, walnuts, coconut and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and carrot cake spices).  The cookie comes in at 310 calories, 18% fiber, with 17g of sugar and 15% iron.<br /><br />I was doubtful that a large cookie would sustain me, as lunch for me is about 5.5 hours away, but I have no problem, this cookie is filling and delicious.  As with any fiber filled product, make sure you do drink fluids.<br /><br />If you do buy these or any of the other Breakfast cookies, be assured that you can freeze and microwave, so on the limited edition flavors, you can buy extra if you really love a particular flavor."", ""I bought these in Mid-July ('09) with 2 day delivery along with 4 other flavors.

So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.

The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you).

Corn starch was the first ingredient.<br /><br />I tend not to like gluten free products made mostly from corn starch. They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.<br /><br />Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it\'s an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.<br /><br />Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that\'s why it gets used a lot.<br /><br />If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these. If you prefer whole grains or even actual flour (not just the starch) I would try something else. I like Christie\'s multigrain crackers or brown rice thins.', ""These were completely repulsive. After I tried one, I looked at the package ingredients. Liquid egg was listed as an ingredient. This explains alot.

My mother turned me onto it a few years back and now I wouldn't think of using a white thickener (flour, corn starch) for any meat or poultry gravy again!<br /><br />What's so fantastic about Bisto Favourite is that you can make as much gravy as you want even from meats that give you hardly any drippings. Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor, color and body.<br /><br />I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally, I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.<br /><br />What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate, pour a little water over it. Place the meat/potatoes/whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus.

The one that was a staple of my childhood (English working class) diet is a steamed suet pudding.  It is made from suet, flour, sugar, currants and raisins, and is usually served with treacle.<br /><br />The Heinz canned version is a very different animal, a member of the sponge pudding race, containing no suet.  It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.  The genuine Spotted Dick (or Dog), described in O'Brian's books, is the glorious suet pudding of my youth.<br />[PeterReeve]"", ""With British food's reputation for tasting like recycled garbage, and a dubious name at best, Spotted Dick sounds more like leftovers from the Saw movies than anything edible.  Nonetheless, I gave some to my girlfriend...and she also ate Spotted Dick.<br /><br />This soggy bread in a can is delightful.  Straying from the typical rubbage on British plates, the injection of flavor from Spotted Dick is a welcome taste.  A sweet treat with hints of cinnamon, this is perfect for a party filled with Dick hungry guests.<br /><br />At ten ounces, each can is roughly four servings based upon the nutritional facts.  That's roughly 1000 calories with about 360 of them fat calories for a total of 40 grams of fat.  To say that this Dick is fat would be an understatement.  With trace amounts of calcium and iron - or so the rumors go - there are some healthy benefits to this charming confection.<br /><br />Highly recommended."", ""Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.<br /><br />Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all).  WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!<br /><br />This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews.

Still, drinking it is very much like drinking a soda, but you get your Vitamin C. I found the balance of sweetness and carbonation to be good, although just a little more carbonation would give this an added zip.<br /><br />What I especially like about this product is that it is all natural and there is no high-fructose corn syrup in the drink. However, this is not a low-calorie beverage, and the 8.3 ounce can had more than 100 calories. If you are going to include this product in your diet, be aware of that. It is fruit juice -- and yes, it has the calories. But this is a food and not just empty soda calories.<br /><br />I gave this flavor 4 stars because I found the kiwi flavor somewhat lacking. It's not bad, I just think the apple juice was more noticeable, although the strawberry flavor came through nicely. A stronger kiwi-strawberry flavor would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />As for the can, I found the zip tab a little difficult to open because of the proximity of the ring to the edge of the can. But I'm a bit of a klutz; I have problems with potato chip bags. So take this caveat with a grain of salt. I think the manufacturer has found a good size for the cans, because you get just enough of the drink to feel like you've had a treat, but not so much that the calorie count is on overkill."", 'I really enjoyed the Switch Kiwi Berry can I received. It is full of flavor and is very good. If you enjoy energy drinks then I recommend this one.', 'I tried the Switch Kiwi Berry drink along with the Switch Black Cherry drink.  I\'ll review them together because there isn\'t that much to write about.<br /><br />First, I\'ll admit a little bias.  I\'m not a fan of sugar-based drinks.  I drink diet pop, Crystal Light drinks, and I use saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose.  I find sugar-based drinks generally ""gummy"", although carbonated drinks are somewhat preferable to non-carbonated drinks.  While there is ""no sugar added"" to these drinks, the fruit juice itself is quite full of sugar.<br /><br />The Switch brand drinks are lightly carbonated, which helps them in my opinion - others may disagree.  The gumminess is still there, though.  The fruit flavor is not strong enough to overcome this and I found that I needed this drink to be extremely cold (as in near frozen) to enjoy it.  I did not like the aluminum can for this product either.  I find that fruit-flavored drinks seem to latch onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks.<br /><br />My personal preference was for the Black Cherry, but others may like the Kiwi Berry.  I can\'t recommend this as a net positive, but my preferences might adversely reflect here - I\'ll rate it as neutral.  If you feel your tastes are similar to mine, you should probably forgo this one.', ""Switch, with it's 100% RDA of Vitamin C, and it's lack of added sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives, is not only healthy, but it has the nice twist of carbonation to appeal to soda drinkers young and old.<br /><br />This is a great beverage for soda-lovers--children and adults alike, as well as for health foodies looking for something a little different. It's an especially great product for kids, because they think they are getting soda, but it's really just fancy juice that's (GULP!) good for them!<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry flavor is sweet, but it's a natural flavor that derives its sweetness from fruit juices. Overall, it's definitely an enjoyable product."", ""How much can you say about a drink? It tastes pretty good! It's got a nice flavor, sweet, but not overly so and there's a good amount of fizz. There's a lot of sugar for the amount of drink you have, and at only 8.3 fluid ounces, there just isn't much there. What's there is good though!"", ""Normally, anything with strawberry and kiwi flavor tends to actually be mainly grape juice and taste like over ripe fruit.  Not this one... it's absolutely delicious, not overly sweet, and actually tastes like the fruit pictured on the can.  I like that it is naturally sweetened, using no corn syrup.  It's not too sweet either.  Just tastes like fizzy fresh fruit.  Highly recommended."", ""If giving your kids, or yourself, carbonated juice gets them (or you) to drink more juice and less soda, that's good.  But the taste of this is similar to the juice in juice boxes.  It's a blend of juices with a fruit punch type of flavor.  It's also quite pricey.  Interesting once, but I won't be buying more."", ""This is a really nice drink -- more satisfying than pop. It's carbonated juice with no sugar or preservatives added. Here's how they can say it's 100 percent juice"", ""Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.<br /><br />I'll say it right off the bat - THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.<br /><br />I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Kiwi Berry was my least favorite of the two flavors (the other was Black Cherry).  The kiwi berry flavor was nice, but a little bit muddled for me.  However, the fruit flavors did taste natural - I just think I would have preferred a simple Kiwi flavor instead of the blend.<br /><br />To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other brands that have a tastier flavor.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars."", ""I have tried a couple of the other Switch flavors, and I found them to be very disappointing.  This variety, on the other hand, had excellent Kiwi and Strawberry flavors.  However, I emphasize FLAVORS because that is where the Switch drinks get gimmicky.  They are all marketed under the flavors/juices that appear WAY DOWN on the ingredient listing.  The several varieties that I have tried all have apple and white grape juice as the top ingredients.  This seems like false advertising to me, since those juices are clearly not as appealing.  Anyway, this drink is all about the marketing.  The price you are paying for 8 ounces of carbonated juice is clearly an extravagance, and I wouldn't do it again.  Save yourself some money and visit the juice aisle at the grocery store."", ""I tried this after reviewing another Switch product (the black cherry flavor). The Kiwi Berry is also tasty, though for the life of me I couldn't taste the kiwi -- just strawberry.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry has the same problem as the Black Cherry, however; just SO much sugar! Ounce for ounce, it's as much sugar as in a regular, non-diet soda. I'd definitely drink any of the Switch products again ... but I won't try to convince myself it's a health drink!"", 'I decided to try the Switch Kiwi Berry drink because I\'m trying to find tasty alternatives to regular cola and I don\'t like most artificially sweetened drinks. Switch did a great job with the kiwi and strawberry flavor of this beverage, but I can\'t shake the feeling that it\'s a drink that is pretending to be healthy even when it\'s not.<br /><br />The Switch can states this drink is made with 100% Juice, all natural, with no sugar added and no corn syrup. That must make it healthy, right? Wrong. This tiny 8.3 ounce can packs 135 calories and 33 grams of sugar! How is that possible? Switch uses fruit ""juice concentrate"" which is just a nice way of saying they process fruit into a sugar syrup and remove almost everything that makes juice healthy in the process. Juice concentrate is barely any better than corn syrup.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a very tasty drink, but don\'t buy it if you\'re looking for a healthy beverage.', 'Like the other flavors of The Switch, Kiwi Berry is sweetened with a mixture of fruit juice concentrates which can lend to it\'s overly sweet taste. Although this flavor wasn\'t as sweet as <a href=""http', ""The Switch Kiwi Berry is a reasonable alternative for soda pop drinkers who want a more natural alternative and the juice drinkers who want something with a bit more fizz.<br /><br />The taste is somewhere between apple and strawberry though kiwi juice is in the ingredients (maybe I just don't know how kiwi juice tastes!).<br /><br />*** Positive Points Include"", ""Way too heavy on carbonation. What flavors were there were too weak to detect. Sorry, but I won't be buying this one."", 'Is it a juice or is it a soda?  It\'s both!  Switch Kiwi Berry canned beverage has enough carbonation for it to be ""soda-like"" but it\'s not overpowering.  This particular flavor is made up of a variety of fruit juices, and I really didn\'t taste too much kiwi or strawberry.  To me, the apple juice flavor was the dominant one.  I like fruit juices and different beverage choices, and I really like the texture of this drink.  However, it is a bit too sweet for my liking and is pretty high in calories.  If the calorie count had been lower, my rating would be higher.  Children would probably really enjoy this drink, and it\'s definitely a healthier option than soft drinks or other sugary options.  I\'d be interested to try some of the other flavors!', ""SWITCH KIWI BERRY carbonated juice is a pleasant surprise.  Although I don't drink carbonated juices as much as I used to, I have been disappointed in the few that I have had in the past year.<br /><br />KIWI BERRY SWITCH is a nice carbonated juice.  The bubbles are very fine.  The flavor is not too syrupy, but with lots of impact.  I can taste the strawberry and the kiwi, but it is not overwhelming.  There is a touch of raspberry that I find stronger than the strawberry or kiwi.  I can taste the apple and grape slightly but the berry is much stronger and does not fight with it.<br /><br />There is only 8.3oz per can which can be good and can be bad.  I like it because I rarely want a big can of anything, so it is a nice size for me.  For a thirsty person on a hot day, one will not be enough.<br /><br />This juice stands up to some ice too without becoming flavorless which I also like."", ""The Switch Kiwi Berry was a good drink. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but not by much. One serving size was 8.3 fluid ounces. It contains 33 grams of sugar and 34 grams of carbs per serving, and each serving was 135 calories. According to the label, it contains 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. The drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda. The small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box.<br /><br />Although I liked it, I don't think it's worth the price of nearly $1 a can. But for the convenience of size, it might be worth the trade-off on occasion."", ""The Switch in Kiwi Berry is a good tasting carbonated drink. It's fruity sweet with a bit of tang.<br /><br />We have made our own carbonated juice or punch drinks in the past using a home carbonating gadget. While it's not hard to do this, we can only make limited quantities and it's not very portable. But we love the results.<br /><br />The Switch took this same idea and packaged in their rather smallish cans. (Good size for kids, a bit too small for adults.) I'm still concerned with the sugar involved. At 35 grams a can, it still seems a bit much. But there is no caffeine, no added corn syrup, no added sugar, or other ingredients normally found in colas.<br /><br />But for what it is, The Switch soda is quite tasty. It's a great alternative to standard sodas out there. (Water is still best!)"", ""A nice juice drink, but it just didn't grab me like other flavors did. I would probably not purchase it in the future, though I did not dislike it. Like I said, it just didn't grab me."", 'I\'ve tried other flavors of Switch before, and I think this one (Kiwi Berry) is my favorite. The flavor is much better than Red Bull or Rockstar, which I\'ve consumed my fair share of over the years. It\'s more like a carbonated fruit drink than an energy drink. I will definitely be purchasing more of these Switch beverages. I like all the flavors I\'ve tried so far. If you are tired of the way energy drinks taste, maybe it\'s time for you to make the ""Switch"".', 'The Switch Kiwi Berry drink is good tasting and all natural.  It should be emphasized that it is full-strength juice, not a ""flavored water"" type product.  For that reason, I found it a bit strong because I am not accustomed to drinking much juice.  The carbonation does add a bit of lightness to it though.  I like that it didn\'t taste too artificial.', ""You'll like it if you like sweet drinks.  Just a bit too sweet for me.  It has a strong flavor odor to it as well.  Doesn't really smell like strawberries or kiwi, but smells sweet."", ""My family and I love Switch!

(And, Dr. Oz has been fairly forthcoming in saying that these products promote free radicals which hurry the aging process). Switch gave me the carbonation and sweet taste that I crave. No, it\'s not my favorite Mountain Dew ... but it\'s a good second-place and a wildly better choice.<br /><br />Some people are complaining about the calories (140 a can). For me (and maybe you), that\'s not a concern. What impresses me is that this drink is 100% juice.

Switch blends fruit juice concentrates with just the right amount of carbonation for a balance that is refreshing without being too bubbly.<br /><br />Switch manufactures several different flavors of its beverages and kiwi berry is one of several fruit- flavored options. I tend to prefer the taste of citrus, but I love the taste of berries also, provided the blend is just right. Switch Kiwi Berry offers a very good- tasting blend that captures flavors like strawberry and kiwi, along with apple, grape, raspberry, and other natural flavors. The kiwi and the strawberry are most noticeable, but if you search, you will also realize there is a small amount of grape, apple, and other fruits to produce the right balance and right smoothness.<br /><br />Switch Kiwi Berry is great for those who are concerned about their health. This beverage is all natural, contains no preservatives, no added sugar, no corn syrup, no artificial colors, and no gluten. Of course, the fact that there is no added sugar doesn't mean that no sugar exists. There is actually a pretty significant number of grams of natural sugar in each serving, as well as a significant number of calories. These numbers will make Switch unacceptable to those on low carb diets.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, however, Switch Kiwi Berry is a very tasty beverage with lots of sweet berry taste, a full day's supply of vitamin C, and no preservatives. It offers all- natural composition with a taste that is sweet and satisfying and a carbonation level that is just enough to make it refreshing without going overboard."", 'I was intrigued by this product.  Once it arrived, my son was as well.  So, I shared it and anothere flavor with him.  My assessment was that it has a pleasant taste but--unless I had read the can--I am not sure I would be able to identify it as Kiwi-Berry.  It also has a slight aftertaste--not unpleasaant, but just there.  Also, I am not too sure I need the carbonation with fruit juice.  My 8 year old son on the other hand loved it.  He raved about the taste and the bubbles, claiming it tastes like Sprite only much better.  He seemed to like this and the other flavors about the same.  I would suggest this as something to try, but hesitate on buying more since the price is realtively high compared to other beverage options.', 'This is a good drink, tastes like soda, but fruity.  I really liked it, nice alternative to soda.', 'The Switch Kiwi Berry is really good.  The taste is different.  It has a nice sour taste, and also is healthier than soda due to the low sugar content.', 'I really enjoy trying new things, so I found the idea of this soda pleasing. It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink. This might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be. However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this ""natural"" drink tastes a bit artificial. This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always have a more muddled flavor.  Having tried many of the Switch flavors, I find this one, like the watermelon, a bit plain and unexciting for a drink which purports to ""switch"" my world around.  The flavor really reminds me of strawberry-kiwi Snapple, which isn\'t a bad thing other than the lack of originality, and the carbonation is very pleasant.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.  If this is your first try at the Switch fruit sodas, I suggest trying the tangerine variety first, as it really better encapsulates the bright flavors of fresh fruit that I think the company is trying to achieve.', ""Kiwi Berry is the fourth Switch flavor I've tried.  Only one of the flavors (tangerine) tasted like the fruit on the label; the others (Black Cherry and Watermelon-Strawberry) tasted like carbonated apple juice to me.  So, when I opened this, I wasn't quite sure what I'd get.  I'm happy to report that this tastes like fresh kiwis and berries.  It's sweet enough, without being too sweet, and it has plenty of carbonation.  This, along with the tangerine flavor, will be a favorite of mine."", 'This drink is a great alternative to soda.

It has a nice smooth taste with a nice aftertaste of kiwi and strawberry.  As usual, the dominant first taste is apple and grape but the aftertaste comes on quickly.

So, it was a hit at our house and we'll definitely be buying more."", ""I was not overly impressed with this entry into the 'natural' soda sweepstakes. The flavor was OK, but it was achingly sweet.

While the ingredient list certainly does confirm the particularly natural recipe required to create this beverage, I\'m afraid I cannot endorse it very highly.  I have long been perturbed by drinks of this nature.  Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated-beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of ""Switch,"" probably wouldn\'t think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.<br /><br />The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but it\'s still too sweet.  It\'s also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half-hearted attempt at ""carbonation"" that this beverage and others like it undertake; it\'s carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as ""carbonated"" should commit to the practice as well as the soda-pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldn\'t be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.<br /><br />In short, I wouldn\'t go out of my way to purchase ""Switch.""

(Why 8.3 ounces?)  I wonder if the market for this drink is for those who must religiously consume liquids in extreme moderation.

Since I have recently kicked my 15 year habit of drinking Diet Coke, I have been looking for a substitute drink that wasn't straight fruit juice or straight soda. As an American I have become accustomed to thinking that carbonated drinks are the fun ones and that merely being healthy by drinking juice is boring.

I love carbonation. I love juice. Put them together and you should have a sweeter version of what you can make with club soda and juice. So one star earned for the idea. One star for the convenience of me not having to mix my own club soda with juice and one star for convenience that it is in a can. As for taste - I didn't like it much at all. It was just too sweet. I like soda, but this was just over the top. This particular version my wife and I both agreed that it tasted really close to strawberry poprocks, which in and of itself is a good thing. I just didn't care for it as a carbonated fruit juice.  I'm going to give this a partial fail. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't buy it again."", ""As a health nut, I want to know what's going into my body. I try to buy things with ingredients I recognize.

The taste is very bold- much more than you'd expect than something 'healthy.' but healthy it is- and it's excellent!"", ""My husband and I tried the Orange Tangerine version of Switch, and also picked up this can of Kiwi Berry.  I thought we'd like the orange better, but we both ended up loving this Kiwi Berry.<br /><br />The taste is a perfect blend of tangy kiwi with smooth berry blended underneath.  This could be a heavy and sharp flavor without the sparkling water added, but together this is a very flavorful and refreshing drink.<br /><br />Our only disappointment was in the small size (8.3 oz) for the price.  This is very good tasting stuff, but I don't know how often we'll pay this much for a sip of goodness."", ""This is very good.  A nice berry flavor with just a hint of kiwi, and very sweet even with no added sugar. The fruit flavors are strong, but very natural, without the unpleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste some fruit beverages can leave you with.<br /><br />The carbonation is nice - it's not too bubbly, but just pleasantly effervescent.<br /><br />This is a product I would definitely buy at a convinence store instead of a soda, but I had to take away one star since I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is."", 'Switch is the ""all natural"" soda that has no sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives and with vitamin C.  The flavor in question is kiwi berry.  I must admit this is the third beverage by Switch that I have tried and I believe it tastes the best.  The other flavors I have tried didn\'t taste bad, but really didn\'t taste like the flavors they were promoting.  This soda tastes both like kiwi and berry.  A very crisp and light flavored drink and it is only 135 calories a can.  This isn\'t a bad alternative to a basic can of soda, but the calories in a can of Switch aren\'t too far from a can of Coke/Pepsi.', 'The taste of The Switch Kiwi-Berry, reminds me of Jell-O fruit flavored pops.  I happen to like this flavor, but I wouldn\'t call it Kiwi-Berry.

The ingredients listed seem to be natural and I do not feel sick after drinking it (as I normally feel after drinking corn filled sodas).<br /><br />I recommend The Switch Kiwi-Berry for people who like fruit flavored sodas without high fructose corn syrup.

We would never drink anything this cloyingly sweet.  It's made with fruit juice concentrates and flavorings reconstituted with filtered sparkling water.  What I'd rather have, and what I make at home frequently, is a normal fruit juice, such as pineapple (no sugar added) and sparkling mineral water.  It cuts the sweetness of the juice, has just enough flavor, a little fizz and is even good for you.  Switch, I'm afraid has none of this, it's just too sweet and has too much fake flavoring.  We tried the Kiwi Berry and it tasted like overpowering strawberry fake-flavoring, like strawberry flavored candies.  Sorry, Switch, but you could make this simpler and better very easily."", ""We've all loved our carbonated drinks. Some of us have gone through (or are in the midst of) real addictions to coke and diet coke. Of course these drinks have caffeine and who doesn't need caffeine. But another attractive feature that leads to addiction is carbonation. Who doesn't like that fizzy feeling?<br />So, why not take a reasonably healthy drink like 100% fruit juice and make it carbonated? Brilliant! You get the sugar rush (but healthy sugars!) and the carbonation, without the crazy ingredients of most soda drinks.<br />You'll never need a mystery-fruit-flavored high fructose corn syrup, Yellow Dye # 9 concoction again!<br />I just wish the cans were a little bigger. This is one drink that can afford to be super-sized."", 'The can is pretty, a vibrant carnation pink. But although the can purports to contain 100% juice, a quick inspection reveals that apple and grape, not kiwi and berry (strawberry, raspberry) get top billing on the ingredients list.  Unsurprisingly, the flavor seems a little muddled, a little tangy, awfully sweet.  One family member described it as bubble gummy, another noted that it tasted metallic but ""maybe in a glass bottle it would taste okay.""<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, this product is heavy on fruit sugars, though I appreciate the absence of that cloying corn syrup sweetener that contaminates so many popular soft drinks.  There is nothing particularly nutritious about Switch, but maybe some parents (presumably the target market) won\'t be able to figure that out.<br /><br />It\'s not the worst carbonated beverage I\'ve ever tried, but it\'s nowhere near the best, nor does it have the fresh wholesome flavor that we spoiled consumers expect from our fruit juices.  I\'ll stick with water.', ""I tried this, just one can, and am glad I had not bought more.  I do admire the company for coming up with an alternative to typical soft drinks but it's not for me.  I'd describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added.  Plenty of carbonation is essential to a soft drink, it makes it sparkly and refreshing, plus it counteracts the sweetness.  As I said I'm glad it was just one can, my only regret is that I wasted 1.5 ounces of perfectly good vodka trying to make it more palatable and it didn't."", 'I did not find this drink special in terms of taste; it is kiwi juice infused with carbonation, and a burst of strawberry.

I hope other reviewers find this drink a little more interesting.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http', ""This product is absolutely not to my taste.  It is advertised as a carbonated juice drink, so I kinda expected something along the lines of Welch's Sparkling Grape Juice; I was wrong.

The strawberry/kiwi flavor is very muted and is masked by something terrible.  The taste was bad going down but worse after a minute or so, as the aftertaste is strong and unpleasant.<br /><br />On top of the bad taste and unpleasant aroma, the drink has a considerable amount of calories for a small can at 135 calories per 8.3 ounces.

So while I strongly disliked the Switch Black Cherry flavor, I wanted to keep an open mind to Switch Kiwi Berry. While I started off with an open mind, after drinking most of the can I wished I kept a closed mouth. I found the carbonation level to be satisfactory, but I felt the so-called Kiwi Berry flavor could be summed up in one very technical term -- Yuck! Not only was the flavor bad going down, it left a lingering unpleasant aftertaste. Further, the 8.3 fl oz drink is high in total carbs (34g), sugar (33g) and calories (135). My overall opinion of this product is the same as it was for the Black Cherry variety -- i.e., it is not worth drinking even for free (as I did thanks to the Vine program).

And for once in a kiwi/berry drink you can taste the kiwi, I'd be very hard pressed to tell the difference between this and a traditional soda.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it's in a tall and slender can, fits in the fridge better and you can't mistake it for that pesky regular soda... "", ""I'm a bit perplexed wondering what void in the beverage market this is intended to fill.  Imagine a super sweet slightly carbonated juice drink with an almost syrupy consistency and you have The Switch.  I had to drink a tall glass of water after drinking a can of this carbonated candy in a can because it's anything but refreshing."", ""I found this soda simultaneously sweet and tart, which is interesting, with no bitter aftertaste or the acidic feeling of regular dark soda. It was a bit too sweet for me, and I couldn't taste the kiwi nor was I wowed over by the taste of fresh strawberries. In fact, it was not that much different than Hanson's (although I like their taste better). It's 100% juice and carbonated - I figured it would either taste like sparkling cider or something similar orange soda, but neither is correct. It seems a bit heavier than cider and not as bubbly as orange soda. It does not really have a fresh fruit taste to it, and it is a bit heavy on the taste (e.g. not a subtle, light taste).<br /><br />Being 100% juice this could be a better choice than soda for kids. But with 135 calories and 11% of your RDA of sugar in a small 8 oz can, you are only improving over the dyes and additives. If the sugars concern you, compare this to Soda Club's drinks and you will be much happier there. However, it does sport 100% of RDA of Vitamin C - so it might have a slight cold-fighting benefit as well. For an adult, I would pass. The soda is sized for kids and that also means more waste generated. It would be too easy to chug 4 of these, and while being fat free, it is not easy on the calories.<br /><br />Bottom line"", ""This product is good. However, I feel the carbonation is a little more emphasised over the fruity flavor. Unless of course carbonation is really wanted. I didn't find the juice flavour as good as Juicy Juice.

We both found this a satisfying drink, and one with just the right amount of berry flavor. It is not oversweet, nor does it have that funky aftertaste many ""non-soda"" soda type drinks do. My son gave it his thumbs up and said he would drink it. I liked the flavor combination as well, kiwi and berry, and would buy this product.', 'I was a little disappointed with this soda.  True, it\'s all natural and only fruit juice sweetened, but it\'s too sweet for my taste.  I diluted it with cold water, and enjoyed it.

The taste was unique and refreshing and not too sweet consider the amount of sugars.  Maybe it's the natural fruit juices that add to the sugar content.<br /><br />One thing that is not good is that the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  This add loads of sugar and calories, and, the 135 in this small can might be better spent elsewhere for us dieting officinados.

The result was a drink that\'s a little sweet for my taste but one that most people will probably like. It\'s 33 grams of sugar per serving; I generally find fruit juices and pop to run about 28 grams of sugar. Then again, that\'s corn syrup, not ""sugar"" per se.<br /><br />The flavor reminded me a bit of raspberry ginger ale (possibly influenced by its similar color). The smell of the drink is amazing and the consensus in our little at-home taste test was that it smelled better than it tasted.<br /><br />I would definitely try this in a party punch or similar. As for drinking it straight, it was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised. I would try other flavors and buy this if I saw it in the store.', ""I didn't expect this to be this fizzy. Sure it's not like a Pepsi, but if you want some carbonation from a beverage in a healthier manner, this is a great alternative.

It is refreshing, new, and something I would consider drinking again.  I leave off the final fifth star, as it was not the most flavorful beverage of the group, but I believe that owes to the fact that there are multiple flavors competing for a spot on your palatte.

Once I had it all nice and chilled, I popped the top and listed to the fizz.  It was not quite the satisfying pop and fizz of a Coca-Cola, but that is because this drink has less carbonation.  When I took a sip, I was immediately transported back to grade school field trips where we were given bag lunches with juice boxes.  While it was a nice moment of nostalgia, the novelty quickly wore off.  The juice was nice, but I am not sure the carbonation really added anything to it.<br /><br />My biggest concern really deals more with the people who may not do their due diligence before deciding to purchase this product.  If you have a soda addiction, but you drink diet soda, this would be a calorie explosion.  While it is natural juice, you must remember that natural juice is high in sugar.  If you are accustomed to guzzling three or four sodas per day (or more) then you would not want to replace them with this beverage.  It must be approached with the same dietary caution as you would use with regular juice.  But if you have difficulty drinking juice or getting your recommended fruit servings each day, this might be a fun alternative.<br /><br />The price is high compared to soda, but it is low compared to some other individually bottled/canned juices.  I really liked the light kiwi/berry taste more than the black cherry.

I'm willing to give up the 100 plus calories this has per serving to get 100% of the RDA of vitamin C and feel really refreshed. I think this product is so good because there is no sticky sweetness, no heaviness like regular juice has. The carbonation and the proportion of the various juices fits my palate perfectly. I would love a larger serving, but the calories would get out of hand. I may never go back to straight juice again."", 'The Switch is a great alternative to the usual carbonated sodas.  It is all natural and 100% juice with all the vitamin C a body needs.  It tastes just about as sweet as soda but without the corn syrup/sugar.  It is less carbonated than soda but I like that.  It also has a ""lighter"", crisper taste.  The Kiwi Berry flavor is good but my favorite is the Black Cherry flavor.  I recommend both but keep in mind that the can is only 8.3 ounces and costs more than soda.  I think it is worth it!', ""Flavor is light, mostly strawberry, as is the can. Switch is all-natural fruit juice, and the ingredients are a shortlist of -- well, carbonated fruit juice. Big thumbs up, when you compare the list on every other soft-drink can. The portion size is 8.3 oz., which probably less than you're used to in a canned drink. The Switch seems to me to be a wonderful flavor, satisfying. It was a pleasant experience without guilt. Try it and see for yourself."", 'I really enjoyed the taste of this product. It neither seemed too ""berry"" or too ""kiwi"" -- it was a nice balance. I would compare this to a strongly-flavored carbonated water product. The flavor is clean and crisp, and not overpowering.<br /><br />The product provides 100% of vitamin C -- a definite plus. However, the product has 34g of carbs, 33g of which are sugars. Granted, these are not processed sugars and are only natural sugars from the fruit juices the product contains. However, this results in a product that has 135 calories in an 8.3-ounce can. This results in a poor substitute for soda.<br /><br />It\'s an all-natural product, and tastes great, but has entirely too many calories for such a small serving.', ""The Switch Kiwi Berry is a nice refreshing alternative to the typical carbonated soft-drinks on the market.<br /><br />The taste although unusual at first is rather pleasant once you get used to it. I'd describe it as a cross between those Dole Blended juices and soda water. Strange as it sounds it actually tastes good.<br /><br />Although I suppose it's slightly better for you than soda - The Switch doesn't use High-Fructose Corn Syrup - it's still full of calories and carbs.<br /><br />Still for people who generally don't drink soda such as myself but find themselves occasionally craving a carbonated beverage this is a nice alternative.<br /><br />The can is only 8.3 oz. which does make it considerably smaller than a can of soda. As long as you can stick to only drinking one you'll be slightly better off than drinking a typical non-diet soda."", 'In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices', ""Having now tried several Switch drinks, I'm quite pleased with how they've chosen to enter the market with this product-line. The flavors they've introduced are well thought out, generally taste good, and are really a good set of drinks I'd consider purchasing.<br /><br />The downsides? It's probably not big enough. 8.3 ounces is quite small. I know it's probably more of a specialty drink, but I did feel like I still needed more after drinking the entire can. It's possible they intended that to make you purchase more.<br /><br />That being said the black cherry was by far my most favorite. Again, these are great drinks. Definitely worth trying and seeing if they can become a part of your regular drink selection."", ""This drink is a nice change of pace from soda.  It is an all NATURAL beverage with NO JUNK IN IT.  It is made only of juice and carbonation and that is it.  We couldn't believe it when we tried it!  It tastes really great and if I were looking for a drink without caffeine I would choose this.  The Switch is really tasty and satisfying.  I also liked that the carbonation is not quite as heavy as some sodas.  My family of four tried it and we all decided that we would buy this brand again."", 'The taste of this was like a pop but it was very refreshing to the mouth.  I liked it because it was healthier than a pop , had great taste and it was very refreshing.', 'This is the second flavor of this line of drinks that I have tried (I have also tried the cherry one)  It was a nice fruity flavor and I enjoyed the drink. I love the fact that this beverage has no added sugar.  Just beware that that does not mean that there is no sugar as you get a lot of sugars from the fruit juices.  I think that this is a great drink and would recommend it to people my only real major complaint is that the cans are too small and I really feel that I need a second can to quench my thirst.

And mine both did...but I wasn't sharing any more of this delicious drink. No sir, I'm happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly.<br /><br />I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind. The kiwi-strawberry taste was just right...not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing. In fact, this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and don't really want or need another soda.<br /><br />This is good stuff...get some."", 'Kiwi and strawberry are a good combination, and combined with a bit of carbonation, this drink ""hits the spot"".

I am a big fan!  It was a little bit too sweet, but I'm hoping other flavors will tone that done a little.  I suspect that the 135 calories for this perfectly sized can is due to the fruit itself, and not added sugar, although there is acerola in it - which is also known as the Puerto Rican Cherry.  That means no added sugar at all.  Try this - I don't think you'll regret it."", 'This drink is refreshing, but a little too sweet for me.

While the juices in this can are apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry in order of their respective strengths, the strawberry flavor stands out the most.

It's a little expensive for an 8.3oz can but I'd purchase this again."", 'This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a ""diet"" drink.

Many people remark regarding the calories, but they are no different from any other 100% fruit juice & better for you than soda! Yes it is a bit pricey but it seems to be about average in comparison to similar beverages sold in individual portions..............you are paying for CONVENIENCE!  IF you want to save money just but a fruit concentrate & seltzer/soda water & mix up your own blend (like we do!)

The drink is refreshing but if you are thristy this 8.3oz can won\'t be enough.  The cost is too way expensive to enjoy this drink on a regular basis.

I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's."", 'The product description says it\'s ""just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C.""

I enjoyed the light fruity flavor instead of the intensity and heaviness of the popular canned cola drinks.  The effervescence was perfect....again, not so intense as the other sodas.  The cans are small(only 8.3 oz.), but adequate for a small thirst.  The idea of healthy 100% fruit juices combined with a slight carbonation is fine for children and adults alike.

I really enjoyed Switch Soda .its something different. Taking juice, putting some carbonation in it. Almost in a vague way reminds me of those sparkling grape juice drinks you get around the holidays if you don\'t drink wine. Its very good. I would definitely buy it again. However the no sugar added part can be a bit ""misleading"" as you as the label states 33 grams per serving but it\'s only one serving per can but us diabetics should probably only drink this when we have low sugars like I just did bonus is no high fructose corn syrup which isn\'t very good anyhow. I liked this and would buy more to keep around the house the days I have my sugar lows as It didn\'t seem to be to overpowering to me. I liked the kiwi,berry as I am a fan of strawberry and kiwi both. I thought personally it was a very interesting soft drink . I really like this infusion stuff they have these days like Dr pepper put  cherry. chocolate diet one year ago and such. Switch kind if is like that.

If kiwi flavor had been absent I don't think I could differentiate this product from a berry soda you can get from any vending machine.

You really can't put fresh fruit in a canned drink.

I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion (""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.

So apart from the no sugar added, preservatives and all the added artifial stuff, there is not much of a difference in nutrition between these two products. Need the Vitamin C? Drink orange juice.

I agree with the reviewer that said that this tasted like apple juice. It does. It tastes like over sweetened apple juice. There is a slight (very slight) hink of kiwi and none of berries. The sweetness is too strong at first but it does grow on you.<br /><br />This soda has way too much sugar, almost as much as a regular can of soda, and it tastes like it. It is too sweet for my taste. Frankly, giving the calories for this small can, it is not worth it. Now, I would like to try the Diet version if there was one.<br /><br />As for price, each can is about a dollar. Way too expensive. This is like paying $1 for each of those small Coke cans (the 8 oz small cans). Would you pay a dollar for one of those? Neither would I.', ""This carbonated juice drink quenched my thirst.  The small size means you don't have to commit to a huge serving and is a fantastic size for kids who never, ever seem to finish a can of anything.<br /><br />It is 100% juice and makes a very tasty refreshing way to get a serving of fruit for the day.<br />It also has 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C and only 1% sodium.<br />I would absolutely offer this in place of soda for my children."", 'LOVE IT!!!

My son wanted more, but we only had the one can to try.  I love the fact, that it is sugar free and natural flavors. The children loved it straight up, I had to put some ice in mine to dilute it a bit.  This is definitely a great tasting substitute for children and adults, that like the sparkling flavored sodas.  It actually tastes like strawberries, could not taste the kiwi part. We'll have to try the other flavors."", ""The Switch Kiwi Berry soda is an all natural soda. It's a little sweet for my taste.

I do think that perhaps they could dilute it a bit with more carbonated water, as the flavor seems pretty concentrated.  This would probably cut down on the calories and add to the company's bottom line too, as water is cheaper than fruit juice.<br /><br />I also think that the underlying apple juice flavor is bit too pronounced.  I'd like to taste a bit more of the berry and/or kiwi versus apple.  But it is nice to see a carbonated beverage that's made from natural ingredients.

We have had other natural carbonated beverages and enjoyed them, but the family would still choose plain old juice or Sunkist soda over any of these when given the choice.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry Switch has had the same reception. The family finds it to be okay, but nothing that will make them trade in their favorites. It is a fruit drink with light carbonation, more natural than most traditional soda, but still just as sugary, even if the sweetness is primarily from natural fruit sugars. Therefore, I find little reason to encourage them to Switch.<br /><br />Its taste reminded me of the old Strawberry Crush from when I was a kid, but not quite a potent. It is pleasant enough, but as my son put it ""I would drink it if it were all that we had in the fridge but I would not ask you to buy it again"". Also, I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).<br /><br />Bottom line', ""I've read a few reviews for this product complaining that it's too sweet to drink truthfully. I'm a soda drinker but I usually stay away from fruit sodas as they do tend to be sweeter to taste than say a cola or root beer. To me though The Switch billed as a healthier alternative to soda had a less sugary taste compared to something like Fanta or the like that was perfectly fine I suppose if it truthfully was healthier than soda. Personally I never really go for the idea of alternatives and with the price of the product, the ammount given I wouldn't really recommend it over regular water or just drinking some type of juice. Then again if you really must having something billed as a healthy alternative to soda then its not bad I suppose just not something I'd be interested in personally."", ""I can't figure out why anyone would want to drink this stuff!?

There are apple, grape, kiwi, raspberry, strawberry and acerola juices in this drink, all of which combine for a nice flavor.', ""I have tried a couple of the Switch drinks now and as far as I'm concerned they have a great flavor. It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans."", ""The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!

Is it possible to OD on vitamin C?<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is no matter what the combination of juices is, it tastes like cheap candy. Not pleasant at all.', ""The flavor is pretty good.  It's sweet, tart, and tangy.  The calories are okay, 135 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  You wouldn't want to drink a lot of it every day, but 135 calories is fine for once or twice a day.  The fizz is light, similar to Fanta, which is something I really like about this product.  The only thing I don't like is the taste that the vitamin c adds.  The extra vitamin c gives it an aftertaste similar to red bull and other energy drinks.  I think this product would taste a lot better without it, and I don't see any real value in having it.  Vitamin C is one of the easiest vitamins to get.  There aren't a lot of people in the modern world running around with scurvy.<br /><br />The other concern is price.  This stuff is very expensive, almost $1 per 8.3 oz can.  The idea here is suppose to be that this is a soda replacement.  At that price, I don't think so.  A 12 pack of soda (with 12 oz cans) typially runs from $3 - $5.  The Switch costs more than double that.  If this product wants to compete with the soda market they really need to bring the price down.<br /><br />If you like this, just get some low sodium Pellegrino and some concentrated juices.

I know that may seem like a ""DUH!"" moment, but trust me, I\'ve had some that didn\'t smell anything like the fruit they allegedly had in them.  The Switch is lightly carbonated; one thing I really hate is when the carbonation overpowers the drink, but The Switch doesn\'t do that at all.<br /><br />Since there\'s no added sugar in this drink, the sweet comes from the fruit.  That means it\'s not sickeningly sweet when you drink it, but it\'s also not bitter.  There did seem to be more strawberry than kiwi in the drink, but it was very good; a welcome change from typical juice or soda.', ""I was really pleasantly surprised with this drink. It's made from 100 percent fruit juices with no added sugar... and still tastes great. I was surprised that it does actually use the juices that describes the flavor. For example, this product actually contains real Kiwi and a blend of different berry juices. It's kind of a rare thing these days (since everything uses artificial flavors and sweeteners now)<br /><br />The only negative thing I can think of to say is that the bottles are too small.. only 8.3 ounces.  I wish they were at least... 10 ounces (preferably 12 "", ""I think this drink accomplishes what it sets out to... to taste like a sweet can of soda while delivering all the nutrition of its natural fruit juices.

My mind is trained (maybe irreversibly) to associate this type of sweet carbonation with a junk beverage.  I didn't have that good mental feeling after drinking it that I do with juice, milk, water, etc.  I guess that's just my problem!"", 'As a juice freak, I sample just about all of them.

And, like regular soda, it is chock full of ""empty"" carbs -- like eating raw sugar.

It tasted like...  hmm.  I have no idea how to describe its taste.  Sort of like a fruit juice spritzer maybe?<br /><br />It didn't have much of a smell, but there was a distinct strawberry flavor.  It wasn't too sweet, and there was a little tartness to it (the kiwi?).<br /><br />The carbonation was pretty mild, so I didn't feel as bloated as I do when I drink a soft drink.<br /><br />It has about the same number of calories as the equivalent orange juice, and a lot of vitamin C...  but I'm not going to swap it for my morning OJ.

The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.<br /><br />So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy.

The 'tang' of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but - as we knew they would.<br /><br />No thanks."", 'The Switch Kiwi Berry,<br /><br />After tasting ""The Switch"" in Black Cherry, I was a little reluctant to even try the Kiwi Berry flavor. At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds.<br />I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste.<br />Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the ""Switch"" carbonated fruit juice drinks.<br />Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I don\'t care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also. Both during and after you swallow it.', 'One of my friends and her daughter are big fans of The Switch line of drinks because it feels like drinking Hi-C or Koolaid etc, without the sugar or high fructose corn syrup that is in just about every prepackaged drink.<br /><br />While it is encouraging to make something out of 100% juice, I find this to be too sweet. I can taste the kiwi and strawberry, but overall am put off by its sweet taste. I would suggest buying a single or smaller pack before investing in a case of 24. Having said this, the 8.3 ounce can would be perfect for lunches without the problems of the bottle version.', ""I have long believed that you can get anyone to drink anything as long as you add enough sugar to it.  And this drink is proof of that.  It's 100% vitamin C but 34grams of sugar.  I actually think it would taste better if it were not carbonated.  It's just a juice pouch with carbonation.<br /><br />I really liked it, my kids really liked it and it was a very tasty drink.  But again, 34 grams of sugar, wow.  It's also only 8 ounces.  I tried the strawberry kiwi, it left a syrupy taste in my mouth.  I would not purchase again, just because of the sugar level.  If you disregard than it is a good drink nevertheless."", 'When my daughter saw that I had a can of this to try out, she said, ""Oh, you have Switch!""  Apparently it\'s her school\'s answer to soda.<br /><br />I really liked this product.  It\'s a very small can, but for the same calorie content as a similar amount of soda, one can have a carbonated beverage that doesn\'t have added sugar and has some vitamin benefits as well (100% of vitamin C).<br /><br />It was not too sweet, and the flavor was not too strong.  Normally strawberry kiwi is NOT my favorite flavor combination, but I\'m glad I tried it.  I would definitely try it again.', ""This Kiwi Berry flavored drink from The Switch is a refreshing and tasty beverage that beats soda any day of the week.  Though carbonated, the drink has a smooth taste to it and goes down easy, and the Kiwi Berry flavor in particular tastes great.

I would chose flavored seltzer over this any day.', 'Switch promises ""A perfect balance between juice and carbonation"" and it does live up to that as it delivers a fresh burst of stawberry and kiwi (the kiwi could have been a little stronger) and less carbonation then your regular sodas.

I also tried their Orange Tangerine carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well.', ""Switch's Kiwi Berry drink I found a little on the light side, in many ways.  Only 8.3 ounces with very little in the way of kiwi or strawberry flavoring (the can claims raspberry also and it was MIA also).  The most stand out flavor I could detect was the apple juice, which is the major ingrediant.

Another entry into the already boring sparkling juice market, this flavor not only lacked anything new or interesting, but went a step further in its poor flavor.<br /><br />I didn\'t really taste kiwi, and the ""berry"" was bland and unidentifiable (raspberry and strawberry, according to the ingredients list); it was, like most of these juices on the market, mostly apple and grape and not much in the way of uniqueness. In fact, the can I tried actually had a metallic flavor to it--I don\'t know if it was actually picking up the tang from the container, or if it\'s just the poor flavor profile of the beverage. I really don\'t care enough to try it again to find out.<br /><br />Also, I don\'t know why they\'re calling this line SWITCH. It\'s probably a marketing thing--they want people to ""switch"" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. I won\'t be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low-quality drink.', 'Right off the bat, know that Switch isn\'t your traditional soda. There\'s no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It\'s carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it\'s just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />I had this with chips and it wasn\'t a great combination, so I had the drink by itself and it was much, much better. The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I\'m really pleased with this flavor, so I will surely look into the other flavors available, most likely the <a href=""http', ""I tried one 8.3 oz of Switch in Kiwi Berry flavor.

Comparing this to the Black Cherry drink, Kiwi Berry has a better taste and after taste.  However, if you would have told me that this was the Black Cherry flavor, I would have thought that to be true.  I could not note any significant difference between flavors.

While in hiding, she put on a few pounds.  I got to thinking about this and the economy over the winter, and realized that it was better all around, to keep her healthy than to have an ailing senior kitty.  I did some research on what a quality cat food should be and came up with some qualifications and went shopping.  I returned with another brand- reasonably priced and fitting requirements.  My cat liked it alright.  And she lost some weight- fast.<br />  It was serious weight loss and I considered rethinking my own diet, but then we found she had fleas!!!  Poor thing had the worst flea infestation ever (ditto my closet and bedroom)!!!!  Apparently this can happen, even after ten years indoors, if outdoor humans bring flea eggs in on their shoes!!!  I'm told indoor cats often prove the worst flea sufferers- I believe it.  There is no where for them to run or hide.  The flea population explodes fast.<br />  She  dehydrated, anemic and completely exhausted, and dying,  I thought.  She had taken to staying on my window sill and would not touch the ground for anything (where fleas live), but of cousre that would be limitedly safe, too.  Well, I made some trips to the VET and pet stores,  and along with my flea aresenal I purchased some new cats foods to encourage her to eat.  I wanted  something with beef and liver, hoping  to help her get past the anemia.  Beef is harder to find than one might think, but there were a few, including Blue Spa.  I thought it a little expensive, but not when my first baby is so sick!  I opened it  first.  My desparate cat lept off the sill and ran to the kitchen- no lie!  It was the first decent meal she had eaten in days.<br />  Blue Spa Selects start with meat- be it fish, poultry or beef- not meat by products or broth.  The next ingredient is usually chicken and maybe liver.  After that is is a medley of nice vegetables and fruits and stuff-like sweet potatoes, wild rice, cranberries broccoli and blueberries.  The there's all the required nutrients and minerals and such. Sounds like a good meal, now doesn't it?  I admit, I found this concept a little over the top a few year back when I first heard of it.  But, you know, I have had cats who ate vegetables when the opportunity arose (I also had one who LOVED a nice coffee cake before company arrived).  When my sick kitty showed so much enthusiasm for this product, I realized that she must get bored with her food, same as I would.  All the good and different tastes in these little cans could be a new lease on life.  She is still quite thin, but gaining energy, looks good, and loves her new food.<br />  My only complaint is that the beef & liver variety is hard to find (not on Amazon, either, it seems).  We have tried the other flavors, now and they are equally loved.  Also- there's no ginger that I've seen, - a commonly complained about ingredient of a similar brand.  Will be trying other products from this company, soon, once I get rid of my fleas, too.""]"

Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />Tea enthusiasts generally prefer loose tea to tea bags which contain less expensive, smaller particles and the ""fannings"" or ""dust"" remains from processing of loose leaf tea. Moreover, you can sometimes taste the paper used in bags, especially in the weaker teas.<br /><br />However, this Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol\' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings\' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I don\'t think of it as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.)', ""Twinings English Breakfast tea is a good, basic black tea (as is its stronger cousin, Irish Breakfast tea). But I find this loose tea to be a bit of a challenge. It is cut quite finely and no matter how fine the mesh on the infuser or strainer some of this always comes through. I drink a lot of tea and am fine with drinking some tea dust or even a few leaves, but I am talking about a lot of tea here...a teaspoon full or more in each cup.<br /><br />It is true that this tastes better than the bagged variety of Twinings English Breakfast tea. It is smoother and never bitter, as the bagged tea sometimes is. I have compromised and used the loose tea but I strain it through a coffee filter. The tins the tea comes in keep it quite fresh and though straining it is a hassle, it is worth it for me.<br /><br />This is moderately strong (I drink it black) and if you are sensitive to caffeine you might not want to drink it near bedtime. I use Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for this tea; it is a good bargain and I like the convenience of having it delivered. It is also hard to find the loose tea in supermarkets."", ""Rated by America's Test Kitchen as the best tea for iced tea, Twinings English Breakfast tea is perfect for a hot cuppa or for a batch of fresh iced tea. Amazon has the best price I could find for this product, and I have been buying it online from them for several years."", 'Orange Pekoe tea is delicious, fragrant and taste friendly.  It seems to be disappearing off of grocery shelves in favor of the mixed blends, of which I am NOT a fan.  I recommend this taste to all tea drinkers who desire quit balance and taste!']"

The standard recommended serving size for this one is pretty small (only 4 ounces). The recommended Americano portion is 6 ounces, which I prefer. The flavor is dark and rich and really wakes you up in the morning. It also develops a nice cream on top at the end of brewing. Yummy!<br /><br />5/5', 'I prefer my coffee black.  Usually, I turn to my Keurig for a great cup of rich black coffee.  However, the Dolce Gusto does a nice cup of unadorned coffee, as well.  The Caffee Lungo is, indeed, a very nice, naked coffee.  For my taste, though, it is a bit to strongly  flavored.  The frothiness is not altogether to my liking.  However, with a bit of milk and sugar the Lungo is very tasty, indeed.<br /><br />There are two ways to brew it.  The smaller cup is the ""Americano"" while the larger is the Caffee Lungo.  A frothy ""Americano"" seems a bit odd but it is tasty, if a bit to strong.<br /><br />Remember, the strength of the flavor is largely a result of a dark roasting.  A rule of thumb is the darker the roast the less caffeine in the  coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, the Dolce Gusto continues to impress me.', ""This is the best coffee ever! I will never drink regular brewed again. I don't know how I lived without this coffee machine.Love It, Love it, Love it!"", ""Definitely the best tasting, to me. I wasn't sure if it was the milk pods causing the aftertaste or not. I tried the coffee straight with my own milk or creamer, and it tasted better."", 'As the product description says this is the perfect ""all day"" flavor for a wonderful tasting cup of coffee. It doesn\'t matter if you need it as your morning ""go juice"" or an evening coffee. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you don\'t give this one a shot.', ""This coffee is fair, but it seems like a waste of money and the machine.  In my opinion if you're wasting your Dolce Gusto if this is all you use it for.  I'd prefer to make a regular pot of coffee but it is easy to make.  Cost-wise your looking at 50+ cents a cup not to mention the machine cost.  I won't be ordering any more, I'll stick with the Cappuccino."", ""Nescafe Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo is not my morning choice for coffee. For mornings, I like a stronger coffee to really kick off the day, but when it comes to an afternoon pick-me-up, I prefer a medium coffee and the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo fills that nicely. The instructions suggest you do a 4 oz. pull for a Lungo or a 6 oz. pull for an Americano. Somewhere in between works well for me.<br /><br />The coffee has got a slight sharpness to it, but definitely not overwhelming. Like the espresso for the same machine, this blend has nutty hints in the coffee. Overall, it's a nice afternoon blend."", ""Dolce Gusto's Caffee Lungo is their version of plain Ol' Coffee. It is pretty weak flavor, so I didn't really like it--No where near bold enough, lacks flavor. My dad, loved it. So when I need instant coffee, I will be reaching for the espresso pods instead and just pulling 6 ounces (Americano-ish).<br /><br />So while Dolce Gusto will likely replace most of the useage of my espresso machine, I doubt it will make much of a dent in my drip coffee pot's usage, as Caffe Lungo just doesn't measure up."", ""Great cup of morning coffee.  This is a very rich, flavorful coffee.  I am a tea drinker, but like my coffee on a chillier day, and since we've been plagued with cold weather here in the Northeast, I've been enjoying alot of coffee in the mornings!  That being said, I usually brew up a Keurig K-Cup of Donut people coffee (great coffee as well), but decided to go a full week with Caffe Lungo.  I'm happy to report that it is great!  Tastes like fresh brewed coffee from the pot or from the store.  I loved the flavor as much as my beloved Donut people coffee.  Very nice cup of coffee indeed.  My only problem is that Nescafe isn't easy to find where I am and therefore I have to order on Amazon.  Not that it is a problem to order, but I would like to be able to pick one up localy when I run out."", 'My husband admittedly likes mild coffee.  He found this too strong and bitter, but said that some people like it that way.  He will try the mild version next, but said it also tasted like instant coffee.  He poured it out and made a pot of his favorite donut house blend.', 'This morning as part of our ongoing Dolce Gusto tests, I had a Caffe Lungo.  Very good, has a strong flavor and was even good after it got cold (which, sadly, tends to happen to my coffee a lot of time).  I will continue buying this flavor.  I also like this because it is just the coffee - no superfluous milk capsules to lay around and take up space.  This is definitely a repeat flavor for me.  Reminds me of the Nespresso ""Livanto"" flavor which used to be my favorite.', ""The Caffe Lungo capsules produce one of the best Americanos I've ever had. The flavor is as deep and rich as my former $400 espresso machine made. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's better. I was quite surprised at the quality and could drink this everyday. The amount of crema also exceeded what the Senseo produces by a significant amount.<br /><br />I also felt very satisfied after one cup of this although I normally drink a couple of cups of coffee in the morning. For around 50 cents a cup, I would much rather have this than Starbucks any day.<br /><br />Although Nescafe does not have nearly enough varieties of coffee for their Dolce Gusto, this one is a winner."", ""At 50 cents a cup, this is the best cup of coffee I've ever had. I'm addicted to this cup of mood enhancer and I love my dolce gusto!"", 'This tasted old and dry - I found it to taste stale, like old, instant coffee. It was a disappointment because I got this machine for my son to take to college, and had hoped the coffees would taste good.<br /><br />I am still hopeful that other manufacturers will start to make capsules for this machine. But, currently, this is probably the strongest flavor available, and is just not very flavorful.', ""As with many of the flavors we have tried, this one falls into the middle of the road.  We do not drink more than a cup of coffee in a given day, but some of us do like frou-frou coffee now and then.  However, this is not really that type of coffee. I actually prefer my coffee served black, with no sugar, creamer/milk, so I am probably a little more biased.  I think this flavor suits my basic taste range for coffee overall, although I've tasted better."", 'I understand that a lungo is a long espresso. This is also touted as being an ""Americano"" by running more water through it. I guess a purist may not agree with that, but then again a purist probably isn\'t using this machine. I like it most days, Americano style...it is a nice morning cup of coffee...nice frothy top and good flavor. It does sort of remind you of watered down strong coffee (rather than a milder blend) and some days that is the reason I don\'t like it, but different people have different tastes. So I also have a Keurig, but like the foamy-ness of this Lungo, none of my Keurig k-cups get a froth. This and the Chococino are the ones I choose most often...I am not into the milky ones.', '<span class=""tiny""> Length', ""Out of the 5 flavors I tried with the Dolce Gusto machine, this one is definitely the weak link. I did not enjoy the flavor at all - it sort of tasted like stale coffee that sat out for several hours, but was still hot.<br /><br />I tried playing a barista and adjusting coffee levels, but it came out bad every time. A very disappointing flavor, and one that I will not use again. Also, I've noticed that these Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffees have a pretty short shelf life, some shorter than others. So stocking up is not an option."", 'I decided to use this flavor to test the Krups/Nescafe\'s ""iced"" option -- room temp water pressure as opposed to hot -- because every once in a while I like a decaf iced coffee, which means buying an iced decaf Americano (I know this isn\'t decaf) in most shops.<br /><br />This is the Krups/Nescafe ""equivalent"" (I use that term loosely) to an Americano if you use a larger volume of water than for the Lungo.<br /><br />In short, I could barely swallow this stuff.  Cold-pressed, it tastes like end-of-the-day convenience store coffee that has been watered down.  Absolutely terrible.<br /><br />Trying it hot only yields marginally better results.<br /><br />The only reason it got 2 stars from me is because I\'m impressed with the Krups process.  However, I still cannot fathom why a great manufacturer, Krups, chose to partner up on this project with an instant coffee company (Nescafe).  This flavor is the worst so far BY far.', 'This is supposed to be a pretty basic and standard cup of coffee for the Krups machine, but was undrinkable.  I will take Green Mountain coffee over this any day.  Even my husband who is not picky with his coffee at all could not drink this.  He even tried putting creamer and sugar and could not disguise the taste.']"

About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price.  I continued to buy it.  No one told me there was any change in formula.  My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.

She was healthy with a full, shiny coat and plenty of energy.  Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic.  We took her to 2 vets and after several hundred dollars in tests they couldn't find anything wrong with her.<br /><br />I did some research and found that there were numerous people having the exact same problems I was!  It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package.  Do some research, it's not the same high-quality food it used to be!"", ""We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com."", ""We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand.

In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just ""something she picked up,"" but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people\'s dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!', 'My dogs have been eating Canidae for years.  They have always done well on the food.  Currently, I have three dogs and they have had no issues with the new formulations.  I have to say that my black lab mix has an even brighter coat than before.  I love that they came out with a 44# bag.  With three dogs I go through a lot of dog food.  I definitely recommend this food.', ""WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was<br /><br />1 either completely ignored<br /><br />2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the company<br /><br />this is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing"", ""Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE"", ""I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http"", ""I see a lot of negative comments from other reviews but when I look at the ingredients, the cost, and the value, this is the best food I have found.  We have two dogs and this food does them well. I gradually switched over from Blue Buffalo who raised their prices. The Canidae is a better product in my opinion anyway.  I asked the pet supply store owner, and she said in her years despite the negative reviews, there maybe 2-3 bags have ever been returned in her store.  I'm happy with the product and price, and the dogs like it too.""]"

Upon examining the treat up-close, I found it to be waxy, sweetish smelling, and so chock full of preservatives that the fumes made my nose itch. The picture on the package shows a white filling surrounded by meaty goodness. The truth is that the filling is barely noticeable...whatever it is. My dogs would have nothing to do with it.

Both cats chowed down quite happily on the food.  The boy got quite vocal and insistent the next few days about how much he wanted more of the wet food.  Far, far more vocal than he got after getting the 9 Lives canned food before.  Judging from that it seems to be tastier.<br /><br />It definitely looks more appealing to me.  Actual flakes of fish, small shrimp, no unpleasant smell beyond a slight seafood smell.  After putting the food into a bowl the can doesn't look nasty either.  White interior, no discoloration spots.  A quick rinse gets rid of any remaining juices before tossing the can in the recycle bin.<br /><br />Can is made of aluminum, not steel.  Cans are opened with a pull-tab, no can opener required.  The other cat food we had varied; some flavors had a tab on the can to open it and others required a can opener.  In our house it's much nicer when it has a tab to open.  Otherwise I had to go hunting for the can opener after pulling the bowls out of the cupboard.  And of course the cats heard the clang of the bowls coming out of the cupboard which meant they appeared within seconds and promptly started exclaiming how much they wanted the wet stuff while weaving in between the legs in an attempt to get me to give them the food as fast as possible.  We all know how difficult it can be to dodge cats weaving around underfoot  while digging through drawers and cupboards searching for the can opener.<br /><br />Amusingly, the label lists the product as being gluten free.  Not something I expected to see on the label.<br /><br />Overall we're pleased.  I'm not offended by the way the product looks or smells  and the cats love it.  My only complaint is that it is rather pricey compared to other options.<br /><br />Update Feb 17, 2009"", ""I discovered Petite Cuisine when I tried to switch my 13-year-old cat from dry food to canned; I tried every variety of canned food, and while he wouldn't touch any other brand, he inhaled this stuff. I'm a vegetarian, but Petite Cuisine looks more like real chicken/fish than anything I've seen - actual, identifiable strips of meat!  What a concept.<br /><br />My new kittens love it as well, and Chicken Pot Pie is by far their favorite flavor.  It's got a little more fat than the fish flavors, but still well within the AAFCO guidelines. It's also a little more expensive; you can usually get 24-packs of fish flavors for $18 if you go to the manufacturer's web site. But the chicken pot pie makes a great treat for a healthy dinner.<br /><br />But"", ""My cats (all 5 of them) go insane when I bring out the Petite Cuisine.  The red snapper is one of their favorites - have tried several of the PC entrees - only one they didn't go crazy over - the Chicken pot pie - way too much liquid (half the tiny can!)"", ""When I first purchased this product I wasn't sure my cats would like it.  However, I quickly discovered that they do.  It's a pity that they can't do the review.  I've tried a number of different brands of cat food and, though, they still don't eat a lot; this seems to be their favorite.  It smells so good, I feel like I could eat it myself but it's just too expensive."", 'This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l\'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn\'t seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they\'ve grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn\'t have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I\'m not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don\'t want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I\'m concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I\'m also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats\' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line', 'discovered petit cuisine at winn-dixie-bought 4 can variety pack for my cat tut-he preferred tuna/sole and especially red snapper entree-could not buy single cans in store-found them at amazon.com-no more wasting food on tut-i know he will eat his red snapper.', 'I got this new cat food after reading an article in Natural Health magazine\'s October 2008 edition, ""Feed your pet Right"".

I\'ve now tried several other varieties with gravies and they couldn\'t be more enthusiastic.

I think it is fair to say that it is a charming gimmick.  The foods are indeed fashioned after human food, but are more like food for baby humans than us adult humans that prefer strong seasoned flavors.  Of course, that is a good thing, as a healthy diet for a cat is quite different than for a human.  The ingredients, then, are basic, with nothing offensive like wheat-gluten.<br /><br />As for the taste, I agree with other reviewers that this comes down to the preference of each cat, but it has been a great hit with cats in my experience!', 'This cat food is really special.

Since switching to another dog treat, my dog has not had any problems (although it has only been two weeks)."", 'I\'ll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as \'hot spots\' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it\'s possible that they won\'t be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It\'s the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it\'s much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.', 'I do not recommend these for people.

I guess these are good and healthy for dogs - supposedly they are - but they're also pretty expensive.

This toy keeps Max well-occupied for long periods on end.  I started out by really filling the bottle and using smaller treats that would more easily dispense, and once he got the hang of it, used larger treats for increased challenge.  While the tassel on the end of tug rope has been worse for the wear, the rope has withstood Max's chewing well.  Max has been able to figure out various ways of getting to the treats--rolling the bottle around, up-ending it, then knocking it over and tugging on the rope to dispense the treats...As the label says, Max is able to smell, see and hear the treats, and this keeps him interested for hours of play.  I've learned however, that I really have to screw the bottom on extra tightly, as on one occasion he somehow managed to loosen it by repeatedly rolling the bottle, and was able to get to all the treats at once! Suffice to say, he did not have much of an appetite for his evening meal after that!! At the same time I purchased this, I also purchased two Kongs; however, Max prefers the Tug-a-Jug hands down, and generally ignores his other toys--even his previously favourite tug rope--in favour of playing with the Tug-a-Jug All in all, Max rates this toy with 5-stars and thinks his mommy made a wise buy!"", 'WOW, this is a cool dog toy. Have a year and half old Rat Terrier that absolutely loves this thing. I did have to fill it up full(I use cat food) at beginning so she would get rewarded aften but now there is no problem.

Show them they can get out the treat - don't let them get frustrated right away.  So far none of my dogs have destroyed it - very rare to have a durable dog toy in my house.  Good toy for dogs that need a challenge."", 'My dog LOVES this toy but the rope seems too big for the opening, making it virtually impossible to get out any treats.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer regarding this issue and was sent a new rope, just to make sure the bottle I had wasn\'t mismatched with the rope size.  The replacement ended up being the same diameter, so I gave up on the rope altogether.  The way I adjust the difficulty of the ""game"" is by varying the size of the treats inserted.<br /><br />My dog doesn\'t eat kibble so I put in all natural treats, nuts, dehydrated salmon, etc. I sometimes throw in a whole walnut just to make the game harder.  He LOVES the toy and rolls it all over my apartment in an attempt to get everything out.<br /><br />When only the large, impossible-to-get pieces are left, my dog brings it to me out of frustration, and I reward him by opening the bottom and giving him the last pieces.<br /><br />One aspect of this toy that I really like is the fact that you can disassemble and wash it.  Some other toys say they\'re dishwasher safe but can\'t be opened, so I can\'t imagine the cleaning being very thorough.  Also, the ""mouth"" is made of soft rubber that [I would think] massages the dogs\' gums and cleans their teeth a little.<br /><br />Overall this is a great, challenging, tiring game that rewards dogs for their effort and determination.  My only wish is that the rope were a bit thinner, which would make the game ""reasonably"" challenging rather than almost impossible.  This is the only reason why I\'m giving it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />You can\'t go wrong with this toy, even if you use it without the rope.', ""My corgi's are food obsessed and love their Kongs.

Good toy for $10."", ""I bought this toy and the buster cube to be able to leave with my dog on the couple of days he is home alone so that he at least gets a little excitement.  He absolutely loves it, and I recommend it to anyone.  I bought mine before they 'upgraded' to a rubber rope part, but he has only gotten the knot open once so it's not a problem.  It dispenses food quickly enough to keep him interested, and even once he's done eating he still likes to chew on the rubber and rope a little.  I think it was definitely worth the money and recommended it to our local vet who is now carrying it in stock."", ""I give this to my Lab-border collie mix. He inhales his food it's better for his digestion to slow down. It took him less than two days to become proficient with it. After about two weeks we stuck this nubby football toy sold at Complete Petmart in the bottle to slow him and keep him busy longer. It's just the right size to fill the bottle yet allow food to flow down. We do shake it a bit to get the flow started. Using this method it takes him about and hour and half to get all of the food out. He still gets to inhale his food and pester us sometimes it depends on what we're doing.

The bottom has pin size air holes so the dogs can smell the food, the bottle is tinted purple but you can still easily see the food and hear it rattle inside.  The plastic rope part has a 'plug' at the end so if the dogs try to pull the rope, it closes the top exit and food wont come out.  The only downfall are the tiny plastic nubs around the neck of the bottle.  A big rubber covering around the neck of the bottle has tiny numbs which my dogs were able to chew off- but sooo tiny i'm not worried about them at all (and the main plastic covering is still in fantastic condition)<br /><br />I'M ALREADY ON THIS SITE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR MY OTHER DACHSHUND....

I was afraid it may be too big for him to work since we got the medium-large sized jug and he only weighs 18 lbs., but it seems perfect for him now.  It took him a couple of days to figure out how to stand it up, and tip it over to get the treats into the neck of the bottle, and then pull on the rope until a treat comes out.  It works great with his small sized Newman's Own Organics Peanut Butter Dog Treats, and is easy enough to fill.

I tried using larger treats at first (size of large breed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it.

I would definitely recommend this toy but if you have neighbors downstairs, they might hate you.', 'I have three dogs.  A grouchy old schnauzer, and two English Springer Spaniels, one of whom is 10 month old puppy.  Our puppy is, lets say...going through a very distructive stage.

I completely recommend this toy.', ""I got this when a trainer recommended that I find ways to make life more entertaining for my dog. Apparently dogs find working for their dinner to be entertaining. It actually is really great. I just unscrew the bottom, pour the kibble in, and then my dog spends the next 20-30 minutes getting it out. And he does seem entertained - I think eating his food slower makes him feel fuller too. I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good. My friend has a small and a full cup of kibble fits easily into it. Unless you are feeding your dog a lot, you probably don't need the big one."", ""I have a basset hound who loves to get in trouble if he's not occupied.  He's also highly motivated by food.  These two things make the tug a jug perfect for him.  I started him by taking the rope plug out initially (this can easily by done by unscrewing the jug and pulling the plug through).  I lined the rim with peanut butter and put his meal inside.  He quickly learned that rolling it around and tipping it made it dispense food.  After a couple of days of this, I put the plug back in.  He now spends 1.5-2 hours a day trying to empty this thing.  When he's done, he collapses and sleeps.  It's a beautiful thing.  I feed him all his meals in it now and it's his favorite toy."", ""It took a little while (15 minutes or so) for Maya to get used to this and figure out how it worked, but now that she has it has become her favorite toy.  At first, it'd take her about 40 minutes or so to get all the food out (I put her kibble in it), but as she got the hang of it, it would only take her about 10 minutes.  I put a tennis ball inside the jar with the kibble to make it a little harder for her and now, on average, it takes her about 30 minutes.  She loves this toy and I love watching her toss around the jar and fiddling with the rope to get the kibble out."", ""My dog managed to chew threw the rubber tug in less than 30 seconds.  That being said, I can't say that the toy is a total loss.  I turned the leftover part upside down in the jug and it is fairly effective at slowing down the dispensation of the food treats that are inside.  Keeps mine amused for as long as the food is in there"", 'Keeps my choc lab puppy happy for a long time. Started using it to feed her meals so she doesnt inhale her food haha overall she loves it and durable to. If she hasnt destroyed it yet most dogs should be fine!', 'I have two large dogs that are super chewers; they destroy just everything so I was excited to try the tug-a-jug out because of the claim of durable construction.<br /><br />The plastic bottle itself is holding up well.<br /><br />The ""rope,"" which is a rubber/plastic flexible piece that plugs the top of the jug is another story. The half of it that extends out of the jug that is meant for tugging was chewed off in about an hour. It did not crumble or flake though, which was a relief interms of safety. Thankfully, another reviewer had the same experience so I kept a close watch on this. The other  half  still remains in the jug and stills works fine as a plug to keep the treats inside the jug.<br /><br />The other rubber/plastic piece that surrounds the next of the jug/bottle is slowly being chewed away. Many of the flexible dental spikes were also chewed off within the first hour. After a week of use, the main piece has some tears in it. My guess is that it will break off soon.<br /><br />The dogs really like it. One of them sat for two hours trying to get her treats out, so this was a worth while purchase in terms of a toy or  activity that actually keeps my dog busy. There was no tugging though. The dogs just sat and held it in their paws occaisionally rolling it to shift the treats around to get them out.<br /><br />This toy is really not that different than the Kongs that I have, which have survived two years of chewing! The dogs could care less that they can see the treats because they are too busy trying to stick their faces into the open end. This is not a noisy toy.', 'I have 2 pit bulls that love to chew and this toy has suprising lasted a few months.  The rubber on it can be chewed off (so supervision is required), but even with chunks of it gone, it still works great and keeps them busy. Besides the rubber being no challenge to chew through (especially the cord), the biggest down sides are that the plastic is so hard that it could damage some furniture (and feet) and it is loud when they throw it around', 'I love to challenge my dog with food cubes. The thing is great--most of them are way too easy and dispense the food too quickly. This one is perfect because it is a little bit more challenging, and there are ways to make it harder such as adding pieces into the jug to block the food from being dispensed (like a golf ball). Also, the bottom screws off so it is easy to load in the food. Many food cubes you have to load the food in little by little which is annoying when you are trying to feed your dog his entire meal in a puzzle cube~! I highly recommend this one ( i have 2 other puzzle cubes and this is by far the best).', 'My lab absolutely loves this toy.  He acts like a puppy when he plays with it.', 'I am so happy I found this product! Charlie can break through almost any toy but not this one. I was very surprised by how thick the ""jug"" is (I purchased the large.) He loves chewing on the rope which is rubber and so far it has not been broken. The dry food I put inside comes out in the right amount, it doesn\'t fall out like some toys and it is not to difficult like others. I am very very happy and recommend this toy to anyone with a dog that likes to chew and needs to be kept busy.', 'I thought this toy would be great for my dog.  He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great.  However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber ""tug"" rope was broken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he\'ll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he\'ll turn it upsidedown.  Even though he isn\'t using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it.', ""I recently adopted Jake, a 3 yr old German Shepherd Mix from a GSD rescue organization and was excited to introduce him to a variety of new toys.  Most he destroyed within minutes. The Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug is his favorite toy and keeps him challenged and entertained for long periods of time, while other toys get tossed aside.  He has easily figured out how to maneuver the bottle to obtain the kibble inside and it's adorable to watch how excited he becomes when he wins the prize...each and every time.<br /><br />I know that other reviewers have complained that it's difficult for the dog to get the food to come out. Perhaps the pieces are too large or the rope is not extended.  Keeping the rope fully extended for him, Jake is able to retrieve the kibble...not with complete ease...but with a little effort and determination. I would highly recommend this toy for a dog in need of a fun and durable toy that will keep him mentally stimulated."", ""When i got this for my dog, Hilde, i gave it to her and then left for about half an hour.  It had her breakfast kibble in it.  When i came back to check up on her she was trying to use it but couldn't figure it out.  There was also the same amount of food when i came back.  I had to try to help her with it and it was still hard for her.  It was pretty sad because she was going ballistic because she couldn't get the food out.  It seemed like a good idea at first but i dont think my dog very much liked it.  There are scent holes at the bottom and she could see the treats inside so she would try to eat the plastic!  Either this wasnt a very well thought out toy or my dog is dumb! Hope this review helps."", ""We were using a kong treat dispenser ball before which our dog would just toss until all the treats came out and if they didn't come out easily she would just stop playing with it.<br /><br />The tug a jug is great because it requires a more complicated effort on the dog's part to get the treat out.  She finally figure out how to put it upright, knock it over, and then pull on the rope to pull the treat out.  the clear container and the smell holes keep her interested in the toy.<br /><br />the only thing that isn't good about it is that it can be noise on a hard floor."", 'I have a 6 month old lab puppy who is way too smart for her own good.  She is into everything and I swear suffers from ADD.  I got this so I could have a few moments peace and it worked!  Now she has to work for her dinner and it gives me 1/2 hour at a time not to have to worry about her getting into other stuff.', ""My dog Cooper enjoys this toy as much as he loves his Kong toys.  He still hasn't figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him occupied for a couple of hours as he tries to figure out how to get it.  Most of the time he chews on the rope.  He has a strong bite and so far the rope is still holding on strong -- this is also why I bought him the medium/large. I felt that if I got him a small he'd chew the rope right off.<br /><br />The only con is that the toy is a little big for him to carry sometimes, and I didn't realize that the plastic bottle was going to be as hard as it is so it makes loud annoying sounds when it drops on the tile and hard wood when he tries to carry it on top of the sofa or bed. So other than the loud banging noises, I'd say this is a good toy. Highly recommend if you have carpet.""]"

It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.<br /><br />For many people, this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor.""]"

It has a slightly citrusy flavor. Add some vegetables,tofu,and a dab of hot sauce to it--and it's perfect! It's like going to Indochina without paying the air fare. Serve some up!"", ""Annie Chun's Vietnamese Pho Soup Bowl is filling and delicious. A mild scallion flavored broth in soft noodles describes it best adding it has a very fresh taste. I, like another reviewer, prefer to take it up a notch with spice, and thought possibly I'd  be able to taste ginger or other mentioned spices in Annie's description of the soup bowl, but I could not. Nonetheless I would recommend and purchase it again, it was certainly tasty and even similar to restaurant Pho Soup I have eaten from a Vietnamese Restaurant. Added bonuses are the soup comes with an eco-friendly bowl and Annie uses all natural and organic ingredients.""]"

I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!).  Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.<br /><br />I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.<br /><br />I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.  They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator.  The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate.  Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up.

There is no aftertaste but it still has a thick bite to it.  Hard to explain.<br /><br />This can be found for a relatively good price, I buy them at roughly .41cents a cup which is fine with me, only spending $200 on coffee a year is a great habit in my opinion.  I was paying more each year on beans by the bag.  I could have spread the beans out more but I never had good luck with brewing small cups on a drip coffeemaker.<br /><br />.41 cents vs. going to a coffeshop and spending well over twice that = win, plus it tastes great =D<br /><br />Definitely add this k-cup to your collection if you are a fan of house blends', ""I first tasted this coffee as a sample with my new Keurig.

The texture is a little strange at first, comes out of package lumpy when it\'s dry, but mixes up fine.  I also have to use MUCH more water in the recipes than is listed on the box in order to get the right consistency- maybe that is where other reviewers are having taste problems?  Pancakes/waffles cooked up well, thicker than expected so make smaller drops of batter per piece and flatten with spatula as they cook if possible to ensure even heating through the middle and so as to not end up burned.<br /><br />My husband and I have been on Atkins for about 6 months now.  We\'ve splurged on IHOP pancakes a few times in the last few months, and I have to say although the texture is a little different with these, add butter and syrup (even sugar free) this stuff tastes like the real thing.  We can even eat them plain and they taste not too far from normal pancakes.  I suggest adding more water/ half and half in the recipe (for pancakes we added 1 cup half and half, almost 1 cup water to get the consistency we like) because you\'ll find when you mix it up it\'s like the batter is a black hole for moisture.  My tastes haven\'t changed too much and I still by far prefer ""real"" food, but I\'ve found this mix is a completely different ballgame when it comes to ""diabetic/diet"" foods and there\'s not too big a difference.<br /><br />Also, the fiber in this is AWESOME!

Even years after he left the scouts I remained involved at the large regional camp here for the boy scouts teaching survival training. And I still do a lot of hiking and camping on my own. Powdered spices, veggies, cheeses, bullion, and various stocks were a staple item on camping trips due to their convenience.  Some of the dry wares were much better than others.  This tomato powder was definitely one that turned out to be consistently convenient and tasty, and thus worthy of recommending.  We used it when we made stews and soups and it added a flavorful tomato taste to the various broths and stocks.  I would not recommend this product for making tomato soup since its rather costly, and besides, dried soups are easy and cheap for taking along on a hike.  It is best used in enriching the flavor of a soup or stew, whether it be a ready made mix, or one you are making from stock.  It is very rich and surprisingly good.  I took one star off for it is a little costly for only the 2 oz. you get.  But for what its designed for, it is worth the price since you don't use all that much at once.  As I have stated in my other reviews of dried foods like Barry Farm brands, there will always be a core group of consumers that would never give a favorable nod to a powdered food substitute of any kind.  This powder is definitely not going to remind you of the old home days of native tomato's from Grammas back yard for sure.  If you feel you are one of those that never considered a dry substitute of any kind real food, trust me that this is no time to start feeling like Daniel Boone by trying out this powder.  However if you are one that does a lot of hiking and camping where cooking your own meals over an open fire is a big part of that experience, by all means this tasty powder would greatly enliven that experience.  Just remember its rather strong, and expensive, so use sparingly.  Recommended..."", 'This would be a good product for camping, rafting, or hiking trips where you need to save weight.']"

It is much softer than Tofuky Jerky beef jerky replacement, so the texture is easier to deal with, but this flavor is more sweet than the spicy Tofuky Jerky version. I'm excited to taste other flavors to see if there is something a bit on the spicy barbecue side rather than sweet barbecue side, but in general, I really like this and it might convince even the most skeptical meat eater. My dad even liked it, which is saying a lot - he is an old school eater who was very skeptical of anything vegetarian."", ""Vegan or not, teriyaki primal strips are utterly delicious.  I cannot get enough of them.  The flavor is unimaginable.  The texture is incredible.  Everyone I have given samples to has been amazed.  They are expensive, as far as that goes.

These are so darn great that I have't tried any of the other flavors or textures so far."", ""I cannot give high enough praise for these incredibly delicious and protein packed little snacks. Even my very food fussy 5 year old likes them. They are the perfect light lunch or snack to throw in your purse for a busy afternoon. The flavour is delicious, sweet and smokey. At under 100 calories and packed with 10 grams of protein, you can't go wrong. I HIGHLY recommend these snacks, they are worth every penny."", 'The flavor is robust and tangy, and the texture is very pleasing and moderately chewy - not enough to hurt your teeth, just enough to satisfy!

', ""I bought my first Primal Strips seitan jerky at the gym after a workout one day and since then I've been hooked. The mesquite lime is my favorite flavor. Super yummy and only 74 calories.

They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (11g protein, 3g unsaturated fat, 7g carbs.). The Teriyaki variety is a little bland in comparison to some of the other flavors. This may be exactly what some people are looking for. I prefer a little more kick.', 'I am a big fan of Primal Strips. In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The ""lime"" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer.', 'I bought this product by accident one morning at a local deli, and I was very surprised when I first ate it.  Granted, you can easily tell (and I was scared because I was expecting beef jerky when I first bit it) that it is not meat.  But, as an alternative, it is very tasty, and I did end up buying it again.', 'I like most varieties of Primal Strips.

It has the toughest texture which is closest to regular jerky and is the only one made from mostly mushrooms. It is a bit spicy if you never eat spicy foods!"", ""As a vegetarian this item fulfilled my need for protein and also for something that resembles meat.  It's a great snack."", 'WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption ', ""This is a pretty good snack food.  I don't miss meat, but i do miss the seasonings put on it.  This is very tasty and has a nice texture.  A packet is 4 servings, and 100 calories per serving, pretty much equal protein and carbs, so it's a high protein food for most people.<br /><br />Problems"", ""This is a great product, and the mushroom one, the Seitan ones and the Soy ones do, as mentioned, have their individual flavors and textures.  Each is a great treat during a long day at the office when I want something healthy and reasonably low-calorie (these come in at about 75 calories for an ounce.)

I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn\'t a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months\' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read ""Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!""<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won\'t be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they\'re perfect for spring and this coming summer\'s outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!', ""I have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips.

I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch.

The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!"", 'I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store.

I also highly recommend"", ""I've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they've always been terrible.  I didn't expect much when I bought these.  But after I tasted them I was amazed.

Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http', ""We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt."", 'For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less ""natural"" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch.

It sounds like someone is losing business on a product that has been horrible from the beginning and is facing real competition.  Maybe you should spend less money on the marketing of the same recipe of Taster\'s Choice and more money on the development of something that actually is able to compete with VIA.  Back to the drawing board Nescafe.  Your product is horrible and the taste is in the package.  I wouldn\'t recommend this product to anyone.

All were fads that faded over time. Then, through the greatness of Amazon, I found the Whirley popper, and ordered their popcorn to go along with it. It was great, albeit a bit expensive.

No offense to Pop Weaver popcorn because I think it also tastes great. But I like the flavor of the Great American popcorn better. As for unpopped kernels, yes there are unpopped kernels. I think there will always be unpopped kernels. The trick to good popcorn is to turn the heat off when the popping slows. That's where the unpopped kernels come from. I suspect you could get less unpopped kernels if you like burnt popcorn. As for the taste, I think the taste is pretty close to the theater popcorn. The only difference to me is no hot butter. If you want to go EXACTLY like a theater, buy one of those hot butter melters like the theater has. Otherwise it is a great tasting popcorn. The 8 ounce packets give you a lot of popcorn. I believe I remember the packets for the 8 ounce machine saying it has 10 ounces of popcorn in each bag. Great American popcorn from this store seemed to have the best price I could fine and (in my opinion) is definately better tasting than other types of popcorn."", ""My mother gave me one of those old-time, stand up popcorn makers like you see at carnivals or theaters.

You can even add a tiny bit of Orville Redenbacher's Buttery Flavor Popping and Topping oil to get extra butter flavor, like when adding butter topping at the movies. We were concerned about possible lingering popcorn smell in our theater room, but this has not been an issue at all.

Plantation Mint is a rich basic black tea with a fairly strong spearmint flavor.  One of my favorite moments with this tea is taking a nice deep whiff of the aroma from the tea bag right after opening the foil pouch, before I\'ve placed the bag into the water.  It would be a bit too much for me to have this as my normal flavor for every cup (I drink two or three cups of tea a day), but Plantation Mint is one of several Bigelow flavors that I drink perhaps 3 times or so a week each.  Every time I decide to reach for the bright green Plantation Mint bag my mouth starts to water.  Wonderful stuff!<br /><br />If you\'re wondering how this compares with other Bigelow Mint flavors, I would say the ""mintiness"" is similar to that of the Bigelow Green Tea with Mint, or perhaps this Plantation Mint is just a wee bit mintier.  Both are good-- it just depends on whether you\'re in the mood for a cuppa black tea or green tea.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it\'s readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.

I've tried other brands of mint, and I always come back to this one. It has a very pleasant, soothing mint flavor. It's the only hot tea I drink without adding sugar.

I use it only raw, so I can fully appreciate its flavor.<br />I was really pleased to see it here on Amazon, at a price that is slightly lower than in any local stores.<br /><br />What a huge disappointment it was to see, upon delivery, that the bottle was cheap transparent plastic.<br /><br />Decent quality extra virgin olive oil MUST be in glass bottles or at most cans (e.g. Carli oil has some big cans along with glass bottles), even better if dark glass, because light also deteriorates its quality. I am Italian, in Italy extra virgin olive oil is a staple and people use a lot of it. But I have never seen any extra virgin oil sold in plastic, in 24 years that I\'ve lived in Italy.<br /><br />I could not believe that they ruined the Bertolli oil storing it in cheap plastic, and the taste reflects this poor storage. It does not nearly have the same rich taste as the oil that is stored in glass. I believe this is because it has been stored for too long in that worthless bottle. It expires in 1 year so probably it was bottled about 10 months ago.<br /><br />This oil as it is in the plastic is really not worth the price, for the taste it has, you can find some better oils for lower price (while to me the Bertolli oil in glass bottles is UNBEATABLE for its rich taste, and I have tried many many oils).<br />This is why I am canceling my subscription and I am going back buying again the same oil in a local store that sells it in respectable glass bottles.<br /><br />You can google ""extra virgin olive oil plastic"" and you\'ll find many results that advice to stay away from plastic bottles as oils absorb PVCs a lot, even at room temperature. This is unhealthy and it also affects the taste of the oil. Some people think this is no big deal because they cannot notice any difference in taste. But it is a matter of fact that, even if you cannot taste anything different, the oil deteriorates in plastic. Many other foods are perfectly fine stored in plastic, I am not against plastic at all!

After I topped it I put it back in the oven for 10 minutes, and then slid it off off the cookie sheet directly on to the rack to crisp up a bit.

Amazon.com always has it!"", ""We've eaten already-prepared gluten-free bread for years. But with the cut-backs in our budget, I decided to start making my own GF bread. This mix has a very nice texture and good flavor. I did add about 1/4 cup of honey, however, because I like my bread to have a little bit of sweetness to it. I poured the honey into a measuring cup, added the amount of water called for in the recipe and stirred it up good. I then added it to the mix when it called for the water. I also tried the cinnamon bread recipe that they have on the back as a variation and my kids thought it was the best GF bread they had ever had. I used zante currants which are like little tiny raisins. Homemade GF bread is much better than the pre-made stuff. I make about a loaf a week, slice it up, and put it in a ziploc bag in the fridge. We then toast the slices before we use them."", 'I love the texture and flavor of this bread. It is easy to make and freezes well.', ""Since my husband was diagnosed with Celiac, I've become quite the gluten-free baker. I've collected all the ingredients to make great cakes from scratch, however baking bread is a totally different thing. Anyway, the entire line of Pamela's gluten-free, wheat-free flours are fantastic. I love making pizza with this flour. It's gives a fluffier and slightly sweet crust. The trick with this pizza dough is to bake it 'til it's slightly brown before you put the toppings on. you'll get a very crispy crust. I also have fun with her suggestion of adding herbs to the flour while mixing. I also sprinkle herbs on with a little olive oil before the first bake.  I use this flour weekly for focaccia...Oh, and no eggs!"", 'This wheat free bread mix is great my whole family enjoys the taste and we add ground flax to it also.

We can use the bread for just about anything; french toast, sandwich's, etc. It's great to have a good tasting alternative."", 'This is a great bread. Tastey and moist.

She had become so discouraged with the Gluten-Free Breads available that she didn't even want to try this one.  Finally, she can eat bread that actually tastes like real bread and toasts like real bread.  I give it 4 stars only because Mom says that it still is missing the air pockets in regular bread.  It freezes great.  Thank you Pamela for letting my mother enjoy bread once again."", 'Well, I haven\'t found a better bread, so this works for now. It\'s easy to make in the bread machine but it sure isn\'t the taste & texture of ""wheat"" bread.', ""This bread is very tasty.  I like it because it's so moist and maintains its texture instead of becoming crumbly the second day after being baked.  It is so easy to make sandwiches, spread margarine or peanut butter and in general, do whatever we would normally do with bread.  We are able to fully enjoy bread now instead of eating the cardboard-textured bread we were buying.  I love this bread and highly recommend all Pamela's Products.<br /><br />Also, the subscribe and save plan has been a great deal for my family.  We save money and I don't have to remember to go online to order.

I just love it!"", 'I\'ve tried ten different GF bread mixes, and this is the only one that yields a GF bread that my gluten-eating family members like. I have found that the directions apparently used JUMBO eggs. I have tweaked it a bit, using an extra egg white or two for added loft, and when I do the sweet bread, I only use half the sugar amount listed in the recipe on the bag and add a little salt to balance it out. Doing it that way, my ""I-only-eat-bakery-breads"" hubby LOVES it.<br /><br />I use a Zoji bread machine on the QUICK course setting, LIGHT crust. This keeps it from being overkneaded or baking out the moisture. Then I cool it completely on a wire rack (uncovered). The loaf lasts a week at room temp without molding (if it\'s not eaten faster than that).<br /><br />This bread is PERFECT FOR SANDWICHES, because it is sturdy and not crumbly or dry. You DON\'T HAVE TO TOAST IT TO TOLERATE IT.<br /><br />Other GF bread mixes I have tried include 2 different ones from Gluten Free Pantry, 2 from Bob\'s Red Mill, 1 from Orgran, 4 types from Breads From Anna (=our 2nd choice), & Namaste. All of these molded within 2 days at room temp, and refrigerating/freezing made it necessary to toast it to make it tolerable. With the exception of Breads from Anna, all the other ones I listed in this paragraph are really worthy of use for bread crumbs or croutons or making stuffing...but not much else.', ""I had been making the Red Mill bread, but I have to say this blows away the competion in both taste and ease.  I don't have to add a bunch of extra different ingredients (like egg whites, butter, etc).  Good flavor & nice looking loaf.  The bread is soft as one reviewer mentioned. We don't mind, but some might."", 'Best gluten-free bread by far. We make ours in the bread machine and little over 2 hours and delicious fresh bread. Buying in bulk is smart if you eat alot of bread.', ""Since learning my husband has celiac disease, he hasn't been able to eat pizza with us on homemade pizza nights. It used to be a treat. So I was excited when I first tried the bread mix thinking he could enjoy pizza again. However, the dough never seems to bake throughout; it always turns out gummy. We've tried letting it rise even longer than the hour recommended, even that didn't help. I still have a few bags left so I'm going to try something other than pizza.""]"

So, I was happy to see this product on Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as other reviewers experienced, many of the cans arrived dented. In fact ALL 12 CANS were dented, most severely so.  Thing is, unless Amazon wrapped the cans to the case flats, this was not an Amazon issue.  The case pack was well buffered in a larger box that was completely undamaged; neither the shrink-wrap nor the flat were damaged; and even the inner cans in the case were bashed up.<br /><br />This clearly indicates that the manufacturer -- or whomever wrapped the cases -- shipped already and obviously damaged cans.

And using the same ingredients I always do in the dish I used it, it was sub par.  I have since sent the product back mainly because of the dented situation - otherwise, I probably would have given it to a food bank or something - they don't take dented cans either and rightfully so!

The cans arrived in great condition.  There was a tiny dent on maybe 2 or 3 cans (just like I might find on the grocery shelf). I was very happy with my order.  Maybe it has something to do with the warehouse it is shipping from.  I live in CA and Ontrac delivered it. I've been so impressed with Ontrac. Amazon has been using them alot lately.<br /><br />I went ahead and ordered 2 more cases and hope they arrive in the same condition.  The date on the cans is 6/2012.

So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what\'s happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog\'s anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.

Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients.', ""I am very disappointed that this Happy Hips product is made in China now. If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog.

I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product.

My Great Dane is not a ""swallow whole"" kind of eater - he tries to chew up even the tiniest training treats before swallowing them, BUT with rawhide strips like these he will chew on the whole piece until it eventually becomes soft, then swallow it. Whole. Then choke it back up, chew some more and swallow it whole again. Repeat until it goes down and stays down. This is not healthy and not very safe and I always have to be poised to remove the offending chunk of soft wet rawhide from his throat as he gags it up. He does love these chews but I have not seen any wonderful changes in his teeth so far with 2 weeks of daily use so it will not be worth the trouble or risk of choking for me to buy more once this bag is gone. I now wish I had gotten the smaller quantity bag so I could be done with these sooner!<br />Edited to add that I finally finished the whole bag and still didnt see any big changes to his teeth or gums. Also, the coating comes off on his white legs and my carpet and they make his breath smell weird (not fresh, kind of medicine like). I will never buy these again.', 'My two Golden Retrievers have been devouring the CET HEXtra Premium Chews for two years.  These chews have cut down the number of dental cleanings and they just love the chews.  I am really happy with the results.']"

I ordered the CET chews to keep her teeth clean.  She absolutely loves the flavor, but because the rawhide is so thin, she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it, I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today, she choked again, and I wasn\'t able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could breath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these, but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.  I will stick with brushing her teeth and getting her teeth annually by the vet.<br /><br />My dog - 70 pounds, 1 year old lab/Shepard mix.  She eats the beef Orijen food blended with California natural.<br /><br />Edit -<br /><br />My dog Taro is now three and a half and I see these chews at the Vet clinic I go to.  I also see that this product has really great reviews so I am sure that it works for most people\'s dogs and people love the product...I just urge you to be very cautious if you purchase this chew and stay with your dog when they are chewing on it.  I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children, the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.<br /><br />It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1-4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of ""is this useful votes"" is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.  I hope this isn\'t the case because they would be toying with the danger of killing our dogs.']"

Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor.

Sodium nitrite has been linked to migraines and colon cancer and has been used as a poison in larger quantities.', ""When I first encountered these Cowboy Strips I as a bit confused. Were they in fact made of beef or cowboy? Since cannibalism hasn't generally been in practice for quite some time (and even when it was, only by savages of the worst sort), I felt it was quite likely that the 'beef' mentioned in the title was the meat source, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibility to believe these to be beef flavored COWBOY strips made from real life cowboys. That thought caused my stomach to turn, and because I take great pride in leading a cannibalism free lifestyle, I decided it might be wise to contact the manufacturers of WILD RIDE just to double check--similarly I once contacted the makers of the very confusingly named 'chicken of the sea' brand tuna fish to see if it was chicken or fish; quite an important distinction! Better safe than sorry over having broken my nearly 30 year streak of cannibalism avoidance in one fell swoop, I gave WILD RIDE a call!<br /><br />Thankfully, WILD RIDE confirmed that this was in fact BEEF jerky, and that the Cowboy reference in the title was just an adjective explaining the sort of jerky it is"", ""It has MSG.  That was not mentioned on any of the description nor on the manufacture's web-site.  Other than that, it tasted okay and the texture was average."", 'The Jerky had a nice, seasoned flavor to it, but I did not really enjoy the consistency and texture of it.  Rather than being chewy like other jerky I eat, it was much more crumbly.  Another reviewer mentioned it, but I thought that I would try it myself because I enjoy trying new things.  Not sure that I would recommend it to another jerky aficionado, but I have 3 more bags to eat and the flavor of the meat is good.', ""I prefer jerky on the tender side, so I really enjoyed the original Wild Ride natural style, but I also don't have any hangups about additives, so the new Cowboy Strips line totally blows away the flavor of the bigger brands I'm used to; same tenderness as the organic Wild Ride stuff, but with even more taste.  And if you haven't tried the Pepper yet, you're missing out!"", 'Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn\'t taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that\'s the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it\'s got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It\'s also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn\'t really bother me so much, but it\'s definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn\'t buy it again.

While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.

However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable.

I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten.

Well I don't wanna chance it."", ""It gets one star for the price, fat and salt content and because it's 3.65 oz. rather than the 4 oz. in brands available in local groceries.  The pieces were thick and flat, which is more attractive than the wrinkly stuff.  But the fat content is 13% compared to a more typical 2% and delivers 35 fat calories per 1 oz serving compared to a typical 5 calories from fat in a 1 oz. serving from the three different brands our local Kroger Grocery carries.  All that fat didn't make it more tender or less chewy.  And that fat is displacing protein in a 1 oz serving, so 1 0z. delivers 90 calories instead of 70.

Still back before microwaves there were commercials starring Orville Redenbacher, and geeky as that guy seemed, he seemed to know something about popcorn.<br /><br />NOW we have microwaves and, frankly, Orville\'s off-spring haven\'t kept up.

I empty the bag and the familiar residue of a teaspoon of unpopped kernels just plain isn\'t there.<br /><br />THAT would be reason enough to rejoice, but Pop-Secret exceeds my expectations.

Back in those days mom taught us to melt a bit of butter and sprinkle that with just a touch of salt onto our snowy stacks of popped corn.

The Mrs. makes fun of me for how much I love it, but I think the Mrs. and God understand.  Pop-Secret Homestyle is not only the BEST doggone popcorn you can get, but stick a bag in your microwave, push the ""popcorn"" button, and a few minutes later you have a little bag of heaven.

Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That\'s a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).', ""I ate beef jerky every single day at my school cafeteria when I was growing up. I loved the stuff. And then I became a vegetarian and, alas, I thought my beef jerky days were done for. Until I discovered this. It is very convincing - the texture isn't gross or suspect like many fake meat products. It isn't too tough, is a bit moist, and has a nice flavor. It is much softer than Tofuky Jerky beef jerky replacement, so the texture is easier to deal with, but this flavor is more sweet than the spicy Tofuky Jerky version. I'm excited to taste other flavors to see if there is something a bit on the spicy barbecue side rather than sweet barbecue side, but in general, I really like this and it might convince even the most skeptical meat eater. My dad even liked it, which is saying a lot - he is an old school eater who was very skeptical of anything vegetarian."", ""Vegan or not, teriyaki primal strips are utterly delicious.  I cannot get enough of them.  The flavor is unimaginable.  The texture is incredible.  Everyone I have given samples to has been amazed.  They are expensive, as far as that goes.

These are so darn great that I have't tried any of the other flavors or textures so far."", ""I cannot give high enough praise for these incredibly delicious and protein packed little snacks. Even my very food fussy 5 year old likes them. They are the perfect light lunch or snack to throw in your purse for a busy afternoon. The flavour is delicious, sweet and smokey.

I HIGHLY recommend these snacks, they are worth every penny."", 'The flavor is robust and tangy, and the texture is very pleasing and moderately chewy - not enough to hurt your teeth, just enough to satisfy!

', ""I bought my first Primal Strips seitan jerky at the gym after a workout one day and since then I've been hooked. The mesquite lime is my favorite flavor. Super yummy and only 74 calories. It's a great non-soy protein-filled meatless snack.

They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (11g protein, 3g unsaturated fat, 7g carbs.). The Teriyaki variety is a little bland in comparison to some of the other flavors. This may be exactly what some people are looking for. I prefer a little more kick.', 'I am a big fan of Primal Strips. In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The ""lime"" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer.', 'I bought this product by accident one morning at a local deli, and I was very surprised when I first ate it.  Granted, you can easily tell (and I was scared because I was expecting beef jerky when I first bit it) that it is not meat.

It is a bit spicy if you never eat spicy foods!"", ""As a vegetarian this item fulfilled my need for protein and also for something that resembles meat.  It's a great snack."", 'WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet.

Just have to watch my consumption ', ""This is a pretty good snack food.  I don't miss meat, but i do miss the seasonings put on it.  This is very tasty and has a nice texture.  A packet is 4 servings, and 100 calories per serving, pretty much equal protein and carbs, so it's a high protein food for most people.<br /><br />Problems"", ""This is a great product, and the mushroom one, the Seitan ones and the Soy ones do, as mentioned, have their individual flavors and textures.  Each is a great treat during a long day at the office when I want something healthy and reasonably low-calorie (these come in at about 75 calories for an ounce.)

In my mind, an energy drink had always been any drink with sugar and caffeine levels as high as seen in Monster and Redbull.  My mother one day brought this home from Costco and told me to try it out.<br /><br />It took me probably 2 or 3 drinks to get used to the taste. It wasn\'t that it was terrible. I guess the ""problem"" when I started out was that the taste was just a bit different from what I\'m used to.  But I have to tell ya this company did a great job sweetening the drink without using sugar or some other artificial crap that\'s seen in others.  Once you get used to this drink you find yourself popping one out casually once a day.<br /><br />That being said I\'ve noticed that this drink doesn\'t have the same type of boost you get with caffeine.  The problem with Red Bull and coffee is that the caffeine, while kicking in a lot faster than this drink, also causes you to crash and burn several hours later just as quickly.  This drink however doesn\'t have that effect.  It gives me a subtle yet noticeable boost for several hours before giving me a ""gentle landing"" back to where I usually would be without the drink.<br /><br />Anyhow, that\'s where I am.  Down to 5 tubes and hunting for any deals on this at Costco and here.', 'Found this product initially at Costco and wanted more of one flavor.

Just mix it into a 12 or 16 oz bottle of purified water and shake.  One word of caution, you need to take a couple of swigs from your water bottle before you pour in the Zipfizz, or you will have an eruption of the flavored mix, two or three tablespoons should be adequate.  My favorite flavors are the Berry and Grape.', ""I've been trying zipfizz lately and I'm very surprised at how well this drink seems to be working.  Gives me steady energy without the weird crash I might get from Red Bull or Amp or something juiced with a ton of sugar.  Seems to have a lot of vitamins as well so it's actually good for you!"", ""Grape zipfizz will not dissapoint. It is the least bitter out of their lineup and gives you a great energy boost that doesn't knock you out in 2 hours. I also like how I can fill up a bottle with it instead of having a shot like those other drinks. I like to enjoy it and sip slowly, not just shoot it down and be done with it. I also feel slowly drinking an energy drink evenly will lead to a longer buzz and energetic feeling with less comedown. A+++ for this product."", ""Ultimately, I think personal preference is going to play the main role in whether or not you will like Zipfizz over any other energy drink.  That said, here is what I have experienced<br /><br />Energy Boost<br />For me it gives a nice boost of energy, equivalent to a full cup of coffee.  It seems to last around 5 hours for me without a crash at the end.  I think this is where individuals will have the most variance, as caffeine reacts differently in different people depending on the product.  For example, I don't like what a Diet Coke does to me but I like this.<br /><br />Flavor<br />The flavor is great because it is not overpowering and not to subtle either.  Since it is a mix, you can add more or less water to get the flavor you desire.  I have tried grape, orange, and lemonade.  Grape is my favorite, although an interesting twist on orange is to add a bit of vanilla creamer - it makes for a tasty Creamsicle flavored treat<br /><br />Zipfizz vs 5-hour energy<br />5-hour energy also has the desired energy boost for me, however, it tends to leave me with cotton mouth.  Zipfizz does not do that since it is mixed with water.  I prefer the added hydration.<br /><br />Lastly, often times I only use half of a canister with 16 oz of water.  This helps maximize the value of the product and for me only half of the canister is plenty of an energy boost."", 'I was afraid at firt to try this- I really hate the artificial grape taste of most grape juices and products. This, however, was light- not too sweet. It was a perfect offset to the already existing flavors of Zipfizz- orange, lemon, pink lemonade. (All of which are very tart!)<br />As for energy, this product delivers! I first tried Zipfizz under skepticism, but I was completely and pleasantly surprised that after a thirteen hour work day, I went to the gym right after work that night, and had a nice little burst of energy that lasted as long as I needed it to. There are also no rapid heartbeats, palpitations of the heart or crashes, as the product is made with all natural ingredients. That in itself is a sheer bonus, on top of the fact that there is no sugar or artificial sources of taurine and caffiene.<br />If you despise the taste and the artificial contents of stuff like Red Bull and Rock Star and want an actual energy drink that works as promised, then try Zipfizz, you\'ll be glad you did.<br />Did I mention it\'s also packed with vitamins?
